David Cameron says 'callous murder' of Boris Nemtsov must be rapidly investigated
Prime Minister says "callous murder" of Russian opposition politician "must be
fully, rapidly and transparently investigated, and those responsible brought
to justice"
David Cameron has said he is "shocked and sickened" by the murder of Boris
Nemtsov.
The Prime Minister said the "callous" killing of the Russian opposition
politician "must be fully, rapidly and transparently investigated, and those
responsible brought to justice".
Mr Nemtsov, a leading critic of president Vladimir Putin and of the war in
Ukraine, was gunned down near the Kremlin on the eve of a major rally in
Moscow.
“I am shocked and sickened by the callous murder of Boris Nemtsov as he
walked in the heart Moscow last night," Mr Cameron said in a statement on
Saturday morning.
"This despicable act must be fully, rapidly and transparently investigated,
and those responsible brought to justice."
Mr Putin is reported to have taken personal charge of the investigation which
his spokesman said "has all the makings of a contract hit and is extremely
provocative".
Mr Cameron added: “Boris Nemtsov was a man of courage and conviction. His
life was dedicated to speaking up tirelessly for the Russian people, to
demanding their right to democracy and liberty under the rule of law, and to
an end to corruption.
"He did so without fear, and never gave in to intimidation. He was greatly
admired in Britain, not least by his friend Lady Thatcher, who visited him in
Russia and who would have been appalled by today's news. The courage of
Nemtsov's life contrasts with the utter cowardice of his murder.
“I extend my condolences to Boris Nemtsov's family and friends. The Russian
people have been deprived of a champion of their rights. Boris Nemtsov is
dead. But the values he stood for will never die.”
