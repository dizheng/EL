Oscar Pistorius trial books review – the case that mesmerised the world
Tim Lewis weighs up the evidence from three accounts of a gripping trial
There has never been a criminal trial like it. From the moment Oscar
Pistorius, the sci-fi athlete, shot and killed his model girlfriend, Reeva
Steenkamp, on the morning of Valentine’s Day in 2013, it became irresistible
rolling news. For the first time in South African history, a trial would be
shown, from opening statements to verdict, on live TV. A cable channel soon
offered 24-hour coverage and analysis. And, unlike the OJ Simpson case in
1995, social media stepped in with round-the-clock bloviating by everyone from
experts to Donald Trump. June Steenkamp, Reeva’s mother, remembers that as
Pistorius took the witness stand there was rapt silence in the courtroom; the
only sound was journalists tapping on their screens.
Part of the appeal was superficial: Pistorius, handsome and charismatic, and
Steenkamp, an FHM cover star and aspiring reality-TV star, were a glam couple
(though only of three months’ standing) and her demise suggested perhaps a
jealous crime of passion. But there was deeper intrigue, too: the case
prompted discussion of the astonishing murder rate in South Africa, and
particularly what appeared to be a culture of acceptance of violence by men
against wives and girlfriends. What really fuelled debate, and charged our
imaginations, however, was that, for all the phone records and Whatsapp
messages the court trawled through, Pistorius alone knew whether he actually
meant to kill Steenkamp.
This unknown – and the complexity of separating the signal from a
year-and-a-half’s noise – makes the Pistorius-Steenkamp story a compelling
one for book treatment. Publishers seem to agree. First out of the blocks, in
September, was Oscar: an Accident Waiting to Happen (Kindle only), co-written
by Patricia Taylor, whose daughter Sam dated Pistorius for two (apparently)
tumultuous years. Now, with the benefit of a few weeks’ further reflection,
there are three more.Behind the Door by Mandy Weiner and Barry Bateman
(Macmillan, 576pp, £16.99) could confidently claim to be the most
comprehensive account of the trial. At 550-plus pages of dense print,
including a grisly photo section and floorplan of Pistorius’s bedroom and
bathroom, it is doggedly ordered and authoritative. Parts are satisfyingly
encyclopaedic, but at times the detail is distracting: when Pistorius shoots
Steenkamp, the narrative power dissipates in a fiddly discussion of the
dark-wood magazine rack “packed with glossy titles” next to the toilet, or
the aluminium and glass stand outside that showcased more than 40 pairs of
Oakley sunglasses.
Bateman, a broadcaster for South Africa’s Eyewitness News, acknowledges that
he leans towards “dry, hard-fact accounts of events”, and credits Weiner,
his colleague and the author of a book on Johannesburg’s underworld, with
softening that impulse. Still, Behind the Door might have benefited from more
style, less substance.
The strongest of the accounts in this respect – and the best at supplying a
context for what unfolded – is John Carlin’s Chase Your Shadow: the Trials
of Oscar Pistorius (Atlantic, 384pp, £17.99). Carlin, a fine journalist, is
clearly aware of the filmic potential of the tale; apparently, he was nudged
to write the book by Paul Greengrass, director of the Bourne films. Carlin has
previous here, too – his book Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game
that Made a Nation was turned into Invictus by Clint Eastwood – and his
recreation of that Valentine’s Day morning has the pace and energy of a
movie script earmarked for, say, Channing Tatum and Jennifer Lawrence.
Carlin makes a smart, convincing case that there are “two Oscars” and
that, in this respect, Pistorius is a faithful reflection of South Africa in
2014, a country that is the “undisputed global champion” of rape and
violent crime against women and where 45 people are murdered every day.
“There were two South Africas,” Carlin concludes. “One was uplifting;
the other was frightening. One was made up of people who were unusually
polite, who were generous, indomitable, forgiving and brave; the other of
people who were reckless, volatile, violent, hot-headed.”
What neither book offers is a view on Pistorius’s innocence or guilt. This
is left to June Steenkamp in Reeva: A Mother’s Story (Sphere, 288pp,
£14.99). The Steenkamps have not always been sympathetically portrayed in the
media, maybe because they have demanded money for interviews. (The family
still struggles financially: shortly before she died, Reeva transferred £60
to her parents so they could watch her new reality show on cable TV.)
But June Steenkamp’s book is no lightweight, hastily conceived cash-in but a
forthright and endearingly honest account. Early on, she raises the
possibility that the couple had a terrible row and he violently lost his
temper, “because he shot her not just once, but bang, bang, bang, bang with
9mm bullets until she was dead”. June Steenkamp claims not to hate
Pistorius; she barely knows him. She spoke to him just once: one day, Reeva
called from the car as Pistorius drove at 160mph and her mother, a tough
Lancastrian, scolded him, “If you hurt my baby, I’ll have you wiped
out.”
When Pistorius testified, June Steenkamp sat forward in her seat, eager and,
she says, open-minded to see if he could convince her. It didn’t happen.
Pistorius will have another chance to display contrition when he publishes his
own book, which, predictably, his agent has announced is already taking shape.
