EXCLUSIVE: HILLARY CLINTON’S ‘CONFLICT OF INTEREST’
Citizens United has released a devastating new video, titled, “Conflict of
Interest,” which asks hard-hitting questions about Hillary Clinton’s lack
of transparency in providing information to the public about her Clinton
Family Foundation, which brings in over $200 million dollars in revenue each
year.
The video’s transcript reads:
Its 3am and your children are safe and asleep. But theres a phone in the White
House. And its ringing. Something’s happening in the world. A foreign leader
is calling. And Hillary Clinton is listening. Why? Because he’s also a
contributor to the Clinton Family Foundation. How much foreign money can buy
your president? Can we afford to find out?
Citizens United President David Bossie told Breitbart News that the American
people deserve “100% transparency from the Clinton Family Foundation,” and
that means they should “disclose 100% of their donors–both foreign and
domestic.”
Bossie hoped by pushing Mrs. Clinton to release her donor information, “the
American people would be able to see once and for all whether she is accepting
money from rogue agents, governments, or businesses around the world that may
be trying to gain influence to the Clinton Foundation.”
“There will be a clear conflict of interest involving the countries that
gave the Clinton Foundation money when Hillary Clinton becomes a candidate,
and even more so if she¹s elected president,” predicted Bossie.
“When it comes to the Clintons and foreign money, it’s like déjà vu all
over again.  These shady foreign relationships need to be kept out of the
White House this time,” he told Breitbart News.
Clinton is widely presumed to be a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination in
2016 and has polled very favorably against potential Republican nominees.
On Wednesday, Republican leadership demanded that the White House address
Hillary Clinton’s alleged violations of a “flawed agreement” that was
intended to prevent potential conflicts of interest with her foundation while
she served as secretary of state, McClatchy reported.
In the letter, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus alleged
that Clinton “blatantly ignored” the agreement she signed onto that was
supposed to “alleviate conflicts of interest.”
