Chase Your Shadow: The Trials of Oscar Pistorius
JOHN CARLIN
Atlantic Books, $29.99
The pervading sound of the trial of Oscar Pistorius was that of Pistorius'
whining, sobbing voice as he said he did not mean to kill his girlfriend: it
was an accident, an accident, he loved her.
Author and journalist John Carlin, who has written extensively on South
African issues, including biographies of Nelson Mandela and Playing the Enemy,
has produced a painstaking, detailed account of the life and times of the
Olympic athlete and at various points his prose sounds just as whining as did
Pistorius  in his trial.
In his conclusion Carlin purports that Pistorius reflects South Africa's
development as a nation that today swings between characteristics of arrogance
and progress. His book is, in fact, a spurious justification for a man who
shot four bullets into a toilet door where his girlfriend hid, clutching her
phone and screaming for help. Pistorius is now serving five years for
manslaughter rather than murder. This outcome disguises the seriousness of a
crime that was finally obfuscated by a lack of witnesses and hard evidence.
Pistorius, commonly known as the Blade Runner, comes across in Carlin's book
as a national hero whose physical prowess and athletic ability allowed him to
play out his mercurial nature at will. He toys with a gun that goes off under
a table in a crowded restaurant; he drives fast cars too fast, and he has a
series of volatile relationships with various girlfriends. But you have to
look for these facts, which are almost buried in the text. After initial
release on bail Pistorius is "caged" inside his rich uncle's mansion. The
family is on death-watch because poor Oscar is so depressed. He has been
reduced to a desperately "needy child".
So much sympathy for the man made me want to throw this book at the wall. What
about his victim, Reeva Steenkamp, you want to ask? What about her beautiful
life, which was blown into gory pieces? If Carlin was going to rationalise
Pistorius' crimes in terms of a national characteristic, he would have done
well to dwell on police statistics. According to The Guardian newspaper, seven
women in South Africa were murdered each day in 2011 and one woman is raped
every 17 seconds. But there was apparently no room for an examination of
domestic/public violence against women in Carlin's book, which in effect
diffuses a significant and historic miscarriage of justice.
