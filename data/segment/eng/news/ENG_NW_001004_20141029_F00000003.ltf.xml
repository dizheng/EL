UAE official warns of potential for ISIS-Shabab link
The United Arab Emirates' top diplomat warned Wednesday that the Islamic State
of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group could team up with Islamic militants in
Somalia, saying that more should be done to prepare for such a threat.
ISIS that now controls large parts of Iraq and Syria - also known by the
Arabic acronym Daesh - and the Somali militant Islamic group al-Shabab share a
common pedigree in that they both have had links to al-Qaeda. They frequently
use similar tactics such as explosives-laden cars, suicide bombers and attacks
on civilians.
They operate independently for now, but the Emirati foreign minister, Sheik
Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, suggested that could change.
"What really scares us now is what we see from Daesh, and are we going to see
in the future any sort of collaboration between different terrorist groups
like Daesh and al-Shabab?" Sheik Abdullah said in an address at the opening of
a conference focused on counter-piracy in Somalia.
"I think we should start to ask ourselves: how ready we are as countries,
companies and international organizations in facing these big threats," he
added.
Sheik Abdullah did not cite any specific intelligence pointing to active
collaboration between the groups, but there has been speculation that the
Somali rebels would shift their allegiance from al-Qaeda to ISIS.
The Emirates is a Western-allied, seven-state federation that includes the
Gulf shipping and commercial hub of Dubai and the oil-rich capital, Abu Dhabi.
It is home to a sizable Somali expatriate population and is among the most
prominent Arab allies taking part in U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS.
Al-Shabab last month named a new leader, Ahmad Umar, and reaffirmed its
alignment with al-Qaeda after its longtime head, Ahmed Abdi Godane, was killed
in a U.S. airstrike 105 miles (170 kilometers) south of the Somali capital of
Mogadishu.
The Islamic State group itself began as an Iraqi affiliate of al-Qaeda, but it
was kicked out of the terror network earlier this year.
