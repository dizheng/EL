American Sniper' guitar to be auctioned for charity
Seeking to raise funds for veterans suffering from post traumatic stress
disorder, Nashville-based Gibson Guitars has produced a one-of-a-kind Les Paul
inspired by former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle.
The guitar will go up for auction Thursday at
www.charitybuzz.com/chriskyleguitar with a starting bid of $3,000. Proceeds
from the auction, which closes May 5, will benefit the Guardian for Heroes
Foundation, which provides an array of services to in-need veterans with
disabilities.
The guitar's design features the skull logo that Kyle's SEAL Team Three used
during tours in Iraq, and its control knobs were crafted with shells from the
same kind of ammunition Kyle used in combat.
The project was the brainchild of Nashville country artist Tim Montana, whose
friend was a Marine veteran from Franklin who battled PTSD. Tim Montana and
The Shrednecks will perform at the Chris Kyle Memorial Benefit and Auction,
which takes place May 1-3 in Texas.
"The goal is obviously to raise awareness to PTSD and help raise money for
such a worthy cause in honor of an American hero," Montana said.
Montana inspired by friend's battle
Shortly after arriving in Nashville eight years ago to pursue a career in
music, Montana befriended Hunter Mitchell, a Marine from Franklin.
Montana said he loaded music onto Mitchell's iPod for his deployment in the
Middle East. After Mitchell returned, he shared his struggles with PTSD.
After seeing "American Sniper," Montana contacted the Chris Kyle Foundation
and reached out to Gibson with his idea to make a guitar to auction for
charity. Mitchell died Feb. 6 while the instrument was in production.
"I wrote a song about him and his experiences a couple years ago," Montana
said. "In the midst of this whole thing, he passed away. He told me about (how
PTSD affected him) and helped me see it firsthand."
Montana's song "This Beard Came Here to Party" went viral in 2013 and even
became the unofficial theme song during the Boston Red Sox' championship run.
Guitar has custom paint job
Producing the guitar was a labor of love at the Gibson plant on Massman Drive.
Approximately seven people worked on producing the Les Paul, according to
Frank Johns, Gibson's new product supervisor.
"We created special knobs with the bullet shells," Johns said. "We also did
the special paint job with many layers of paint and masking, not a sticker
that's applied. We created a silk screen for the head stock to commemorate the
event with the official logo."
Alex Juskiewicz, Gibson's global director for entertainment relations, said
such one-of-a-kind guitars typically sell for a pretty penny, especially an
instrument with such a unique backstory.
"We really do try to give back. We have a foundation set up to give back to a
lot of charities. It's something really ingrained in our company's culture,"
he said.
"Gibson has always been made in America and always will be made in America,
and Chris Kyle did a great thing for this country and we'd like to support
that."
Kyle helped veterans with PTSD
Kyle rose to prominence as the most prolific sniper in American combat
history. His memoir, which inspired the blockbuster Clint Eastwood film
"American Sniper," documented his combat stories and the toll that war took on
him and his family.
In 2013 he was murdered at the age of 38 by another military veteran, who also
reportedly suffered from PTSD. Before his death, Kyle was dedicated to helping
veterans struggling with PTSD, and he helped launch Guardian for Heroes. PTSD
is a condition attributed to witnessing traumatic life events and brings about
depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.
Former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill, who was on the elite unit that killed terrorist
Osama bin Laden, said music can be used to help veterans cope with PTSD.
O'Neill recently joined FOX News as a contributor.
"PTSD doesn't mean you're weak, it means you survived," O'Neill said in a
prepared statement. "A mechanism for coping with anything in the past is great
music. Verbal expressions of our feelings don't do justice to the emotion.
Music gives us power over our demons."
