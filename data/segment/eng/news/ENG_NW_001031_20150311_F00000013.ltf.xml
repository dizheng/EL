Video: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev stood for four minutes outside The Forum restaurant after setting up second bomb
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev stood outside The Forum restaurant with a bomb at his feet
designed to maim and kill in the most horrific way for four minutes while a
crowd cheered runners nearing the finish line of the Boston Marthon.
New surveillance footage presented in his federal death penalty trial showed
Tsarnaev make his way to the front of a crowd gathered outside The Forum, drop
a backpack loaded with a pressure cooker bomb, and make a phone call all in
the span of four minutes.
Tsarnaev, wearing a backwards white hat, moves into position in front of The
Forum at approximately 2:45:44 p.m. according to the time stamp on the screen.
The first bomb detonated at the finish line at 2:49:27 p.m. according to the
time stamp. At this time Tsarnaev appears to begin to leave the area.
Approximately 10 seconds later the second bomb goes off and Tsarnaev is moving
down Boylston Street away from The Forum.
Additional footage released in court shows the Tsarnaev brothers approach the
Boylston Street and leave in the panicked aftermath of the bombing.
Martin Richard, 8, and Lu Lingzi, 23, were killed outside The Forum restaurant
by the second bomb.
