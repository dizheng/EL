Here is the face of the man who is behind the AL SHABAAB terror attack in Garissa University
The Kenyan Government has today released the name of the man behind Garissa
University College siege where over 70 students have already been killed and
79 injured in an ongoing siege at the university.
According to Interior Coordination Cabinet Secretary, Joseph Nkaissery, the
man behind the Garissa University terror attack is Mohamed Kuno, a former
teacher at a Madrassa in the area and is the leader of a local Al Shabaab cell
in Kenya.
The Government also placed a Sh 20 million bounty on the terrorist who is also
behind the Lamu and Mpeketoni massacres.
Unconfirmed military sources have indicated that more than 200 students of
Garissa University are still being held hostage by over 13 gunmen and the
death toll could rise even as the Kenya Special forces tries to rescue them.
Meanwhile, the US Government has strongly condemned Al Shabaab's terror attack
today at Garissa University College, which has resulted in the deaths and
injuries of many Kenyans.
In a statement to the press, US Ambassador to Kenya, Robert Godec, said the US
Government remains a committed friend of Kenya and will stand shoulder to
shoulder with the Government and the people of Kenya in their effort to end
the scourge of terrorism.
