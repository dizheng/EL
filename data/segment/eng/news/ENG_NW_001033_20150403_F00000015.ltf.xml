EU vows support after Garissa massacre
The European Union pledged Friday to support Kenya's fight against extremism
after 147 people were killed by Al-Shabaab gunmen in an attack on Garissa
University College.
"Violent extremism has once again targeted the right of the people of Kenya to
live in peace and freedom of religion," the bloc's foreign policy chief
Federica Mogherini said in a statement.
"The terrorists showed their determination to undermine education, to provoke
division between different faiths, to deprive the country of a future of
economic and cultural growth, of stability and dignity for all its citizens."
Mogherini, the former Italian foreign minister, restated the 28-nation EU's
support for Kenya in "overcoming the threat from such terrorism", adding that
it was "important that all play their part if we are to achieve that."
"The EU's solidarity at this time is assured, and we will work on reinforcing
our support for Kenya's counter-terrorism efforts," she said.
Pope Francis has led worldwide condemnation of the day-long siege at the
university, the country's deadliest attack since the 1998 bombing of the US
embassy in Nairobi.
