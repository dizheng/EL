Bibi wins big
As Netanyahu seems set to return to power, his relations with the Obama White
House appear to reach a new low.
Barack Obama might have hoped for a leadership change that would reboot his
poisoned relationship with Israel’s government. But he didn’t get it on
Tuesday, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — thanks in part to
a hard lurch right — made a dramatic comeback after trailing in pre-election
polls.
“Against all odds: A great victory for the Likud. A major victory for the
Israeli people,” he posted on Facebook.
With more than 99 percent of the votes counted, Netanyahu’s Likud party had
earned 30 seats in Israel’s Knesset to 24 seats for the center-left Zionist
Union party led by his chief rival, Isaac Herzog. Netanyahu still needs to
assemble a governing coalition to extend his rule, but that should be little
challenge, given his surprisingly strong margin of victory.
Indeed, Netanyahu will likely emerge strengthened, leading a more conservative
coalition than he did before — and likely emboldened in his conflicts with
the Obama administration over how to defend Israel.
The results were demoralizing for Democrats who consider the Israeli leader
tantamount to a partisan rival — particularly since Netanyahu’s March 3
speech to Congress arranged by Speaker John Boehner behind the Obama White
House’s back. In Herzog, Obama officials saw a possible fresh start with
Israel on issues like the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and Iran’s
nuclear program.
“They hate him, they should, and they’re praying that he is out of
power,” said a former senior Obama administration official as early returns
came in Tuesday night.
With those prayers unanswered, Netanyahu’s relations with Obama are likely
to resume at their lowest point yet.
In the closing days of the campaign, Netanyahu seemed to reject his previous
support for a Palestinian state, potentially dashing hopes for a renewed peace
process still nurtured by Secretary of State John Kerry and other U.S.
officials.
Netanyahu also cast himself as the target of foreigners — and while he was
vague about the details, pro-Netanyahu media outlets often cited the role of
former Obama campaign operative Jeremy Bird, who advised a grass-roots
campaign organization that opposes Netanyahu. That group also partnered with
the Washington-based OneVoice Movement, an international grass-roots group
that supports the two-state solution and has taken State Department funding in
the past.
And Netanyahu startled some U.S. observers when he cast the election in a
racial light by ominously warning supporters on Election Day that Israeli
Arabs were turning out in large numbers against him.
Netanyahu’s “scare tactics made the difference,” said Danny Ayalon, who
served as Israel’s ambassador to Washington from 2002 to 2006 under a Likud
government. “He now holds all the cards,” Ayalon said.
In Washington, conservatives expressed delight at the results.
“Sure loser: Obama,” tweeted Weekly Standard editor William Kristol.
“His electoral success is all the more impressive given the powerful forces
that tried to undermine him, including, sadly, the full weight of the Obama
political team. American officials should not be undermining the elected
leaders of our closest allies,” Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said in a
statement.
In particular, defending a nuclear deal with Iran would have been easier for
Obama absent the protests of Netanyahu, who has warned Congress that Obama is
striving for “a very bad deal” with Iran. Herzog also questioned the
pending deal with Iran, but in more muted tones.
Perhaps the biggest question looming over a Netanyahu victory is how the Obama
administration will react to the Israeli leader’s rejection of a Palestinian
state; a day before the election, with his victory uncertain, when an
interviewer asked whether he would oppose the creation of such a state while
prime minister, Netanyahu said yes.
That would be a reversal of Netanyahu’s own stated position, as well a
challenge to U.S. policy set in 2002 by President George W. Bush.
State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki seemed to downplay the remark, saying
that “there are many things said leading up to elections.”
Before the full margin of Netanyahu’s victory was clear on Tuesday, Ayalon
predicted that “Bibi will retract” the statement.
“He made the remarks as a candidate representing Likud,” he added. “As a
prime minister, he represents the government. And that depends on the
coalition he builds.”
By Wednesday morning, some were far more pessimistic.
“With Netanyahu withdrawing his already tenuous support for a Palestinian
state, it’s safe to say that there isn’t a peace process,” said Matthew
Duss, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace.
