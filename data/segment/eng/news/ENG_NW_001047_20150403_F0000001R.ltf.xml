US and Iran hail deal on nuclear framework
The United States, Iran and five other world powers have announced an
agreement outlining limits on Iran’s nuclear programme to block it from
developing atomic weapons.
The move, after marathon negotiations, directs negotiators towards a final
accord this summer.
The US and Iran each hailed the framework, reached by weary but upbeat
diplomats after a week of intense diplomacy in Switzerland that capped 18
months of negotiations.
Speaking from the White House, US president Barack Obama called it a “good
deal” that would address concerns about Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
Crucially for the Iranians, it would also provide them broad relief over time
from international sanctions that have crippled their economy.
Still, critics in both nations as well as wary US allies Israel and Saudi
Arabia, were likely to oppose the “plan of action” because of concessions
allowing Iran to maintain significant elements of a programme that could be
used to produce energy or nuclear arms.
“I am convinced that if this framework leads to a final comprehensive deal,
it will make our country, our allies and our world safer,” Mr Obama
declared. “It is a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives.”
