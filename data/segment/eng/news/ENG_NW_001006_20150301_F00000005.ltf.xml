Slain Russian’s Complicated Romantic Life May Be Key to the Case
Boris Nemtsov's tangled love life is revealed as model Anna Duritskaya helps
police piece the puzzle together
Ukrainian model Anna Duritskaya became a witness to the murder of the
prominent Russian opposition leader 55-year-old Boris Nemtsov, the charismatic
opposition figure and critic of President Vladimir Putin who was shot earlier
today.
Ms. Duritskaya, a 23-year-old Ukrainian citizen, was being interrogated by the
police all night tonight. According to a source in the Russian police, the
young woman had “a very close personal romantic relationship” with the
murdered politician, says TV program Vesti. That relationship is already four
years old—since she was 19 years-old, in other words.
Thanks to Ms. Duritskaya, the police have been able to establish the
chronology of the events of this tragic night. According to her account, she
was waiting for Mr. Nemtsov since 10 p.m. at the Bosco-café of the GUM
shopping mall at the Red Square right across the Kremlin.
The couple had dinner at around 11 p.m. Moscow time and then left the mall and
went for a walk toward Vasilievsky embankment right by the Kremlin walls.
Their intended destination was the posh building half a mile away from the
Kremlin where the murdered politician had an apartment.
As they were crossing the Big New-Moskva Bridge, an unidentified man ran out
of the underpass of the bridge and shot Mr. Nemtsov multiple times. Then he
jumped into the passing white car without a license plate.
Mr. Nemtsov died on the scene.
According to the Speaker for Prosecutor General Office, the “Ukrainian
trace” of the brazen murder is one possible motive of the crime because of
Ms. Duritskaya’s origin and recent arrival from Kiev.
Other motives include a hit by his political enemies, including Russian
nationalists and Islamic terrorists; business deals of the victim; and even
the variant of Mr. Nemtsov’s murder being the “sacred sacrifice” by the
Russia enemies that want to destabilize the political situation in the
country.
Boris Nemtsov is survived by his four children from three of his different
“wives.”
Mr. Nemtsov had a very unusual—some would say scandalous—relationship with
a row of women. Although never divorced from his wife Raisa, during the last
20 years of his life he lived openly with a number of different female civil
partners. He has one daughter with his wife Raisa, a son and a daughter with
the socialite and TV host Ekaterina Odintsova and a daughter with his former
secretary Irina Koroleva, who used to work for the Administration of the
Russian President.
According to Mr. Nemtsov’s friend, while celebrating his 50th anniversary,
Mr. Nemtsov had all his “wives” and children at the same table. He also
never hid the fact that for a number of years he had a “relationship” with
one Anastasia Ogneva, Dni.ru reports.
The spotlight on the complicated personal life of the opposition leader burned
brightly after the organized leak of his private telephone conversation about
opposition journalist and socialite Bozhena Rynska exactly two years ago.
During this conversation, Mr. Nemtsov had this to say about his colleague from
the opposition: “Fuck her! She is The Bitch! Just because I did not fuck her
she was washing my dirty laundry and putting me down in her paper for a year.
And she was writing not on the theme of me fucking her. Let’s organize the
Club of Those Who Never Fucked Bozhena Rynsky!”
Back then, the opposition believes, the leak was organized by the FSB security
service and was directed at Mr. Nemtsov to discredit the politician.
The 23-year-old Ms. Duritskaya, who just arrived from Kiev, is not a suspect,
but possibly was used by the criminals without her knowledge. She calls
herself a model and an actress, although is not known for having any parts in
movies or on the scene. She studied bookkeeping at Kiev University and worked
for obscure model agencies that she left after having found the friendship of
Mr. Nemtsov.
Mr. Nemtsov did not feel safe in Russia and two years ago seriously considered
the possibility of applying for political asylum in Lithuania, according to
the ex-Prime Minister of that country.
