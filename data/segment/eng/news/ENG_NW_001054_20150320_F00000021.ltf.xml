Sons of Turkish academic join extremist group ISIL
Three sons of an assistant professor at a Turkish university left Turkey to
join the extremist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a Turkish
daily has reported.
According to the Hürriyet newspaper, 19-year-old Süleyman Bengi İ., who was
studying at the dentistry faculty of one of Turkey's prominent universities,
Hacettepe University, left the guesthouse in Ankara where he had been staying
on March 10, leaving a note behind that said: “Selamün aleyküm (May God's
peace be with you), dear mother. You may give my belongings to poor and needy
people. God bless you.”
His 16-year-old twin brothers Dilar and Dilşat also left their homes in
Turkey's southeastern city of Diyarbakır on the same day. The parents of the
boys went to the police to report their missing sons and security forces found
video showing the brothers heading to Turkey's border with Syria. The
information was also sent to the National Intelligence Organization (MİT) and
the agency confirmed that the boys had crossed into Syria and joined the
extremist group.
After crossing the border, the brothers reportedly sent a text message to
their parents, reading: “We have found peace here. Do not be concerned about
us.” MİT learned that the boys crossed into Iraq from Syria and got in
touch with them there. Efforts are ongoing to rescue the brothers, according
to Hürriyet. The boys' contacts in Turkey that helped them to join ISIL are
also under investigation.
The father of the teenagers, Assistant Professor M. Şefik İ., asked for help
from the Presidency, the Prime Ministry, MİT and security units to bring his
sons back to Turkey.
In remarks to Hürriyet, the family said they are having difficulty
understanding why their children joined the group.
“The associations, the books they have read made our children reach this
point. We ask the government to bring back our sons,” the parents pleaded.
Süleyman was known to be a successful and quiet boy; however, his opinions
started to change after joining an association and attending meetings at a
publishing house in Ankara, Hürriyet said.
According to the report, citing official records, 2,307 Turkish citizens have
joined the extremist group. Out of this number, more than 500 are still
fighting alongside ISIL. A total of 11 Turks were killed in clashes with ISIL.
Since 2014, 680 families have filed missing persons reports regarding their
children who are assumed to have joined ISIL.
Seven associations in Turkey suspected to be linked with ISIL and al-Qaeda and
recruiting fighters for these groups have been under investigation.
