After Bombing, Shooting, and Carjacking, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Didn’t Shoplift
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev faces 30 charges — 17 of which include the possibility of
the death penalty — for his role in the Boston Marathon bombings and
aftermath. But in a bizarre moment captured on video three days after the
bombing, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev decided not to chance a shoplifting charge.
Surveillance video of carjacking victim Dun Meng’s daring escape shows
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev actively deciding to turn around and return snacks that he
had not yet paid for.
Meng testified on Thursday that he was kidnapped and carjacked at gunpoint by
the brothers on the evening of April 18, 2013. With Tamerlan Tsarnaev
distracted in the driver’s seat and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev gathering snacks
inside a gas station, Meng scrambled to flee the vehicle and make it to
safety.
The older Tsarnaev then rushed into the store to get his brother and leave the
scene before police arrived.
As you can see in the GIF above, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev began to run out of the
store with a handful of snacks. He then abruptly stopped, turned around, and
quickly put the items down near the front counter. Finally, Tsarnaev placed
his empty hands up and made eye contact with the shop owner as he bolted for
the door.
The surveillance video was taken on the evening of April 18, 2013. That’s
three days after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother allegedly set off
explosions that killed three people and injured over 260 others. And it’s
about an hour after the brothers allegedly shot and killed MIT police officer
Sean Collier in his vehicle.
