Media ignores families of ISIS beheading victims
The mother of ISIS beheading victim James Foley told CNN’s Anderson Cooper,
on September 11, that she was “embarrassed and appalled” by the White
House’s handling of her son’s kidnapping. On September 8 a spokesman for
the family of ISIS victim Steven Sotloff claimed that both families were
“bullied and hectored” by the administration.
So how many Big Three (ABC, CBS, NBC) network stories have been devoted to
helping these families tell their shocking stories of a White House that let
them down and even intimidated them? Just three stories: (CBS 2, ABC 1, NBC
0).
However, in the summer of 2005 when anti-Iraq war mom Cindy Sheehan camped out
in front of George W. Bush’s Crawford, Texas ranch the networks flooded
their evening and morning shows with 100 stories (ABC 37, NBC 33, CBS 30) in
the first month (August 9 through September 9) of coverage alone.
The eagerness of the networks to cover Sheehan stands in stark contrast in how
they have covered the Foley and Sotloff families and other parents who have
blamed the Obama administration for the loss of their loved ones. The
complaints by the parents of Benghazi attack victims Sean Smith and Tyrone
Woods also got short shrift on the networks (3 stories). The mother and father
of Fast and Furious victim border agent Brian Terry haven’t found much of an
network outlet for their criticism of Obama and Eric Holder either. (1 story).
The following is a look at how each of these family tragedies have been
covered on the ABC, CBS, NBC evening and morning programs:
While the networks did run stories airing the parents’ pleas before Foley
and Sotloff were executed by ISIS, they curiously decreased their coverage of
those families when they began speaking out against the Obama administration.
CBS ran just two stories. On the September 12 CBS This Morning Charlie Rose
noted “The mother of James Foley, an American journalist is lashing out at
the Obama administration. Diane Foley says U.S. officials threatened to
prosecute her family if tried to raise ransom money. She told CNN’s Anderson
Cooper last night that the government failed her son.” Rose then played a
soundbite from the CNN interview.
On the September 17 CBS This Morning Norah O’Donnell reported: “The
families are making it clear this morning they wanted to do more to save their
loved ones but U.S. officials wouldn’t help…His mother Shirley made a
public appeal to his captors last month, begging for her son’s release. But
behind closed doors, she and the family of James Foley were at odds with the
U.S. government and its longstanding policy against paying ransom to
terrorists…Last May, the families say a White House official threatened
criminal prosecution if they paid a ransom.”
After the O’Donnell piece Rose actually interviewed the Sotloff family
spokesman Barak Barfi who told Rose: “We never really believed that the
administration was doing anything to help us…We had meetings with the
administration. The families sat with this National Security Council official
and basically he bullied and hectored them and they were scared.”
ABC [only carried] a single story about the Foley family charges against the
administration. On the September 12 World News Tonight David Muir introduced a
Brian Ross story: “This evening, anguish and now anger from the parents of
one of those Americans executed by ISIS. They have direct words for President
Obama. They say their son, journalist James Foley, dying an awful death. And
this evening, a startling claim, that the family was actually threatened, they
say, by the White House. Tonight, those parents going very public with this,
talking to our own Brian Ross and Greta Van Susteren over at Fox.”
So far NBC has yet to air any of the Sotloff or Foley family complaints.
