Boyfriend of U.S. woman killed by ISIS describes effort to free her
Had Kayla Mueller told her captors that she was married to her Syrian partner,
she might have been freed; but she denied being his wife.
Kayla Mueller was in a detention cell in Syria, face to face with her
boyfriend who was posing as her husband. Had she told her captors she was
married to Omar Alkhani, she might have been freed from the hands of Islamic
State militants, he said. Instead, she denied being his wife.
Her death was confirmed last week by the U.S. government and Mueller's family.
In the days since, hundreds of people have gathered to honor her in her home
state of Arizona.
Alkhani had persuaded a string of people to let him plead for her release, but
he left empty-handed. He said he saw Mueller's face for just a few seconds
when guards uncovered it to show it.
The guards told Mueller, 26, that Alkhani would not be harmed if she told the
truth, so she apparently stuck to honesty to save him rather than take the
slim chance to save herself, he said.
"Since she's American, they would not let her go anyway. No sense to stay
here, both of us," Alkhani said. "Maybe she wanted to save me. Maybe she
didn't know I came back to save her."
Thinking about others first was Mueller's nature. She had long been content
without spending the wages she earned as an international aid worker on new
clothes, a hair dryer or makeup so she could use her money to help others
instead, Alkhani said.
The Syrian spoke to The Associated Press on Sunday via webcam from Turkey in
one of his first interviews, detailing how he met Mueller in 2010 and the last
time he saw her in 2013 as a prisoner of the Islamic State group.
Mueller and Alkhani were taken hostage in August 2013 after leaving a Doctors
Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, where he was hired to fix the
Internet connection. Mueller had begged him to let her tag along so she could
see the suffering firsthand and help, despite the dangers of traveling into
the war-torn region. He said he agreed reluctantly.
"We argued about it," he said. "In the end, I was afraid if she didn't go with
me, she would go with someone else."
Mueller took advantage of an unexpected overnight stay at the hospital when
the repairs took longer than expected and asked Syrian women about how they
managed daily life. During what should have been a 10-minute trip to the bus
station the next day, Mueller, Alkhani, the taxi driver and a fourth person
were ambushed at gunpoint and threatened with death.
Mueller remained a hostage, while Alkhani said he was released 20 days later
after being beaten and interrogated about his work as a photographer, his
religion and his relationship to Mueller.
Against the advice of his friends, Alkhani said, he returned to Syria from
Turkey later in 2013 to try to get back the woman he met three years earlier
in Cairo after she responded to an advertisement he posted to house
international visitors.
Mueller had stayed less than a week in Cairo, but Alkhani said they quickly
bonded and kept in touch through the Internet and traveled together,
discussing ways they could change the world. They became a couple, and he said
he promised her that he would always look out for her.
While she was in France learning the country's language to go to north Africa,
Mueller encouraged Alkhani to follow his dream of helping fellow Syrians. She
eventually joined him in Turkey near the Syrian border.
Alkhani said he spoke to her often about Syria, where bloodshed has gripped
the country under the regime of embattled President Bashar Assad, and sent her
recordings, photographs and other information that she used for her blog.
Nearly half of Syria's population has been displaced, and some 200,000 people
have died in the fighting.
"She wanted everyone to use their freedom to help us get freedom," he said.
When they were captured together and detained, Alkhani said he at least had
some reassurance she was alive. He would cough or say something to make sure
his voice was heard, and she sometimes would cough in return. Other times, he
or his cellmates would peer under the door and see the sandals she was
wearing, he said.
When Alkhani was released, he was told to forget about Mueller and his camera
equipment.
Alkhani said he has been in touch with Mueller's family and held out hope like
they did during her 18 months of captivity that she was alive. He convinced
himself that the militants would release her, realizing she was only in Syria
to help people.
"I didn't realize one day I will receive this call from somebody telling me,
'I am sorry,'" he said.
A spokesperson for Mueller's family said they have no reason to not trust
Alkhani's account, and the family believes he loved her and tried to help her.
The spokesperson talked to the AP on condition of anonymity because the person
works in media relations for other families in Middle East hostage situations
and wants to remain anonymous for safety reasons.
