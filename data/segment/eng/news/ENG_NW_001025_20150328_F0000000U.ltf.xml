Should grandmothers be minding the kids or running the world?
Does being a good granny mean giving up the second half of your life, like
some of you did the first?
#GrandmothersKnowBest . Yes they do, Hillary Clinton, yes they do.
Clinton was using her sixth tweet of 2015 to get people to vaccinate their
kids. “The science is clear. The earth is round, the sky is blue and
#vaccineswork. Let’s protect all our kids. #GrandmothersKnowBest”.
Being a grandmother to Charlotte – the six-month-old child of Bill and
Hillary Clinton’s daughter Chelsea and her husband Marc Mezvinsky – may
yet knock those blue-stocking edges off Hillary in the eyes of the US
electorate. They love grandmothers.
Kathleen Parker of the Washington Post wrote: “I would submit that
Chelsea’s baby gives Hillary Clinton all the more reason to run for
president. She not only will want to help shape a world in which women lead
nations but also one in which babies and grandmotherhood are celebrated as
integral to women’s lives.”
Meanwhile, to misquote our own first woman president Mary Robinson, this week
we found out that in Ireland the hands that rocked the cradle are still
rocking it. The Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI Family Values poll found grandparents
are the most popular source of childcare for working parents, providing nearly
half of it. There was no gender breakdown of “grandparents” in the survey.
Respondents were not asked if “granny” or “granddad” minded their
grandchildren.
For anyone getting dangerously close to that grandmothering juncture, things
are not looking simple. Unlike Hillary Clinton, few of us are contemplating
running a humongous country. Like Clinton, many of us have a lot done, more to
do.
We might be making some cash working at a supermarket checkout, teaching
people Spanish verbs or writing articles about cross-generational care.
Whatever we are up to, we are actually quite busy.
Should women d’un certain age give everything up to mind their kids’ kids?

Former US president Bill Clinton has suggested his wife would rather be a
grandma than a president. Talking to CBS News last year, he said: “If you
ask her, I think she’d say grandmother, but I have found it best not to
discuss that issue.” No, don’t discuss that issue, Bill.
“There’s a disproportionate attention to her [Clinton] being a
grandmother,” according to Debbie Walsh, of the Center for American Women
and Politics at Rutgers University. “Certainly, many men have run for
president as grandfathers and nobody worries if they can’t do their job.”
Having benefited from grandmotherly goodwill to mind my own children, I know
what a wonderful solution grandmothers can offer. And I am truly grateful. But
as I get close to that juncture myself, things are not looking so simple. My
own offspring can take this as advance notice.
I’m really looking forward to being a granny, but before giving anything up
to look after the next generation, I plan to make sure there is a woman
leading this country, a woman leading the US, and the rights of all women are
vindicated.
I owe that much to my prospective granddaughter.
