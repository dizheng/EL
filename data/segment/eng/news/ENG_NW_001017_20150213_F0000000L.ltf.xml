ISIS claims kidnapping of Egyptians in Libya
Egypt “will spare no effort” in search for kidnapped Egyptians, presidency
says
The self-proclaimed ‘Islamic State’ (ISIS) has allegedly published
photographs of 21 abducted Coptic Christian Egyptians in Libya, while the
Egyptian presidency stated Thursday it will follow up on the incident.
Egypt will “spare no effort in tracking down kidnapped Egyptian citizens”
in Libya, a presidential statement said on Thursday.
The statement added that Egypt will continue communicating with “official
and unofficial Libyan parties” until “the situation is under control”,
the statement added.
Egypt’s Foreign Ministry has repeatedly warned citizens against going into
Libya during the country’s ongoing turmoil.
Egyptians constitute a large portion of the labour force in Libya, and have
been caught up in militia fighting over the past four years since the Libyan
Uprising.
Militia in Libya have kidnapped and killed several Egyptian citizen, including
a doctor, his wife, and his daughter in December.
