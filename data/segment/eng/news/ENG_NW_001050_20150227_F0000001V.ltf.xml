Phone transcript reveals Sara Netanyahu rant at political rival's wife
Binyamin Netanyahu’s wife accuses Monique Ben Melekh and husband Eli Moyal
of jealousy of Israeli prime minister who is ‘admired by the entire world’
Sara Netanyahu, the wife of the Israeli prime minister, has been thrust to the
centre of his election campaignafter the release of an alleged transcript of
her ranting down the phone to the wife of a political rival during the war in
Gaza last summer.
The transcript – written up by an an Israeli journalist who has heard the
tape – was published as Sara Netanyahu gave a lengthy interview in which she
alleged her enemies were trying to humiliate her in their determination to get
at her husband.
Binyamin Netanyahu’s Likud party is nervous that the audio tape itself will
be released to embarrass him on the eve of the 17 March elections in which,
polls suggest, he is trailing his main rival, Yitzhak Herzog.
While she is not up for election, Sara Netanyahu, has been propelled into the
campaign amid allegations regarding her behaviour towards staff in the prime
minister’s official residence and allegations of the couple’s excessive
spending funded by the state.
In the interview in the Jerusalem Post, the educational psychologist describes
her husband as a “hero of the free world” and compares disgruntled staff
to “scheming” servants in Downton Abbey.
Amid speculation that the 30-minute tape would be released by Monique Ben
Melekh, the wife of the former mayor of Sderot, Eli Moyal – who had
criticised Netanyahu’s handling of the Gaza war – journalist Ben Caspit
released his own transcript of the bizarre conversation.
The prime minister’s wife accuses Ben Melekh and her husband of being
jealous of Netanyahu as she brags about his talents and how he is admired and
loved.
“Does anyone in the country want anyone else other than Bibi? Huh?! Someone
in this entire country?! They admire Binyamin Netanyahu the entire world over!
“[He is] a man [who] took all of the State of Israel upon his shoulders; he
sends soldiers to war, he behaves with rare political wisdom, speaks with
leaders all the time! Binyamin Netanyahu’s experience, his wisdom, his
education!
“[He has] extensive education, university degrees. He also reads books,
understands the economy, security, policy, he knows how to speak with leaders
of the world! Where is your man? He doesn’t even reach the ankles of my
husband, what, did Eli Moyal ever speak once with leaders of the world?! Did
he ever do something in his life?
“… He [Binyamin Netanyahu] is one of the most veteran leaders in the
world. In the United States they say that if he had been born in the US,
he’d have been elected president there.”
At one stage, Ben Melekh asks Sara Netanyahu: “Why do you think that Eli is
jealous of the prime minister?”.
The prime minister’s wife replies: “He is jealous of him because he is so
successful, because he is a great leader!! And your man just babbles and
babbles. He is jealous of him because he’s a million times smarter than him,
because he’s a million times more successful, because he’s a giant of a
leader! Where would be today without him? Where? Running from studio to studio
and bragging!! [referring to Moyal] That’s all he knows how to do. He brags
everywhere possible …
“I’m just waiting to see if he gives an interview against me … if he
does that, he will be subhuman …”
In an interview with the Jerusalem Post and the Hebrew newspaper Maariv,
apparently designed to rebuff recent criticism, Sara Netanyahu blamed the
recent media focus on her on a campaign by political enemies – foremost
among them Noni Mozes, publisher of the mass circulation tabloid Yedioth
Ahronoth – and the left wing.
“It’s an elitist and chauvinist approach that blames the woman, that says
everything must be the woman’s fault,” she said. “It’s a very sexist
approach – a concerted effort to humiliate the prime minister’s wife in
her natural role as partner and helpmeet.”
She said the couple had been media targets since 1996 when Netanyahu was first
elected as prime minister.
“We were a young couple from the wrong side of the political map, not bad
looking, educated, with cute little children. As a journalist once told me:
‘If you had been from the left, you, just as you are, would have been our
queen.’”
It seems unlikely, however, that her comments will do much to help dispel the
image some have of her as grandiose, somewhat paranoid and lacking in
judgment.
Elsewhere in the interview, Sara Netanyahu appeared to echo the sentiments
from the taped tirade.
“He’s a hero not only of the Jewish people, but of people everywhere who
feel themselves part of the free world, people who oppose the horrors that
Islamic State is inflicting and Iran’s nuclear plans. I see my relationship
with him as a great responsibility.”
Commenting on allegations made by their former housekeeper regarding her
behaviour, she compared her and her husband’s situation to the British TV
drama Downton Abbey.
“It’s the idea that some people earn their livelihood by throwing dirt on
other people, their reputations – and not just anyone, but someone who you
worked for, who was by your side.
“If you’re unhappy at work, why not just leave? Why do you have to spit
into the well you drank from? What kind of person does something like that? I
can’t help thinking of the BBC drama Downton Abbey, with its
upstairs/downstairs intrigue, scheming staff and the bubbling cauldron of
endless gossip.”
