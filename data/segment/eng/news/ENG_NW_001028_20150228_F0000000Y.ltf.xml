Putin executes opposition leader Nemtsov
Execution of enemy of KGB nation happened at the Bolshoy Zamoskvoretsky
Bridge.
The murder took place the day before the opposition march "Vesna/Spring",
which is scheduled for March 1.
"He was walking along the Bolshoy Zamoskvoretsky Bridge with a woman, unknown
people jumped out of the car and fired 4 times and disappeared", told the KGB.
The murder occurred at Vasilevsky Spusk/Descent. They fired in the back 4 to 7
times.
Opposition leader’s friends and his political allies rushed to the place of
murder.
"Unfortunately, I can see the corpse of Boris Nemtsov in front of me now. At
the Bolshoy Zamoskvoretsky Bridge. I see the body and lots of police around
it", said Ilya Yashin, one of Nemtsov's colleagues in the RPR-Parnassus party.
"I'm shocked, but I'm confident those bastards will pay a heavy price, said
the former Russian Prime Minister Kasyanov. - Now every member of the
opposition needs protection of society".
Cops arrived at the scene of murder immediately frightened away everyone under
the pretext that "experts will have to work".
Kasyanov said he has no versions in connection with the execution of Nemtsov.
"I have no versions, Nemtsov did not tell me of any threats or surveillance",
said Kasyanov.
According to preliminary information, at the time of the crime a native of
Kiev, born in 1991, was with Nemtsov. On the radio station Echo of Moscow
Yashin said that she did not suffer and is being interrogated. According to
Yashin, this woman told him what had happened.
Almost immediately after the murder, Putin press secretary Pesikov, and then
the Kremlin ghoul himself declared that "the crime could have been a contract
murder and has an exclusively provocative character is".
Putin also hastened to declare that he "intended to personally monitor the
investigation into the murder". Of course, who else doubted it. So it will be
easier to hide traces of the crime, as in the case of the murder of Polish
President Kaczynski and Polish elite.
This is an old trick of the KGB-FSB. To kill a political opponent, and then
resent in response to charges of murder - "are we such idiots to frame
themselves. It's all provocateurs who so wish us harm".
Putin has done this trick in the case of Yushenkov, Kaczynski, Politkovskaya,
Berezovsky, Litvinenko. Now - Nemtsov.
One of the first expressed condolences was president of Ukraine Petro
Poroshenko. "Shock. They killed Boris. It's hard to believe. I have no doubt
the killers will be found. Sooner or later. Eternal memory...", he wrote on
Twitter.
By the way, Nemtsov was killed a few meters from the Kremlin, in a heavy
protected area.
2 weeks before the murder Nemtsov in an interview said that Putin could kill
him.
In recent years, Nemtsov was one of the dissidents’ leaders of a Western
democratist orientation. During his last visit to Vilnius, he asked the media
not to call him either a politician or an opposition leader, but only a
dissident same, as the KGB captured and illegally holding the powe, completely
deprived him of every kind of political influence.
KGB thugs in their blogs are rejoicing.
- Boris Nemtsov, you run off my dear friend, writes "sotsializator.rf" and
presents the following picture of a liquidator of Nemtsov.
