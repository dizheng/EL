Journalists surprised by top secrecy surrounding "Tsarnaev's case". Is there something to hide?
American journalists are frustrated by the behavior of US District Court in
Boston, writes The Washington Post, whose correspondent Gessen has been
covering the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
In American courts, no video, or audio recording- or photos of the proceedings
is ever allowed, and transcripts are quite difficult to get, the newspaper
writes.
"But local court reporters say they have never faced the sort of restrictions
imposed by judge O’Toole in the case of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The bulk of files
in the case are under seal – including at least one defense motion that was
excerpted at length by The Boston Globe before the judge sealed it last week
– and reporters are excluded from seeing or hearing much of the courtroom
discussions that would customarily be public", the article says
The trial is in the voir dire stage, the individual interview part of
selecting a jury. On Wednesday, The Boston Globe filed a motion requesting
public – meaning media – access to some of the challenges made to juror
candidates by the lawyers on either side and the judge’s rulings on these
challenges.
"If a juror is so obviously dead-set on voting for the death penalty or,
conversely, if a juror is unequivocally opposed to the death penalty, both
sides may agree on the spot that the person cannot meaningfully participate in
the penalty phase of the trial", the newspaper explains.
The court has interviewed 98 people so far. "It would appear that most of them
cannot serve on the jury, either because they hold strong beliefs about
Tsarnaev’s guilt or about the death penalty", the newspaper writes.
In open court proceedings, O’Toole said he didn’t want to tell jurors
directly that they have been excused because he doesn’t want to “coach”
other candidates on how to get out of jury duty in this case. "That may be a
part of the reason he has closed the afternoon discussions to the press –
though he has not explained this decision. Nor has he explained the decision
to exclude journalists physically from the courtroom", the article says.
Such restrictions in this court have not even been seen during the last year's
trial of a notorious Boston gangster, Whitey Bulger.
As a result, they agreed the access to the courtroom for three journalists.
The time at which the court mutes the microphone, has been slowly shortening,
too, and journalists can hear a little more. "Still, no one has been able to
hear any of the chats that go on between Tsarnaev and public defender Miriam
Conrad, who sits to his right", notes the newspaper.
