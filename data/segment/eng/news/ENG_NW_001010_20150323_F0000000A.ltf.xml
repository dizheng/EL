Hillary Clinton Jokes About Fresh Start With the Press
The presumptive presidential frontrunner for the Democrats told a gathering of
journalists she was ready to give up her "zone of privacy."
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledged her rocky history with
the political press on Monday and said she hopes to turn over a new leaf as
she heads into a new campaign season as she implored journalists to focus on
telling substantive stories.
“My relationship with the press has been, at times, shall we say,
complicated,” she said as she addressed an awards ceremony celebrating the
late New York Times political reporter Robin Toner. Journalists filled the
two-dozen tables at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
Washington think tank, as did a few press-facing current and former White
House staffers.
But as she prepares to launch her second presidential campaign and builds a
press team that’s notably more cooperative than the one that worked for her
in 2008, she conveyed that ready for a reset.
"I am all about new beginnings,” she said. "A new grandchild, another new
hairstyle, a new e-mail account. The relationship with the press. So here
goes: no more secrecy. No more zone of privacy. After all, what good did that
do me?”
Then, she joked, with a hint that her transformation may not be a full one:
"before I go any further, look under your chair, you’ll find a simple
non-disclosure agreement my attorneys drew up. Old habits last."
Clinton started on a light note but turned more serious. "We and our democracy
depend on you,” she said before urging the reporters in the room to follow
Toner’s lead and write substantive stories about policy.
She conceded that “it has gotten even harder to do the kind of journalism
that she did” as the country and the media have gotten more polarized, and
technology has put new pressures on reporters.
“I think the stakes are really high,” she said, with too much political
discourse taking place in an “evidence-free zone.” The realities of the
industry make it difficult, but it’s important to try to "get us out of the
echo chambers we all inhabit.”
“I believe we need more Robin Toners,” she added.
Toner covered politics and also had an emphasis in her reporting on health
care policy. Her final interview with Clinton, in the fall of 2007, was about
the then-
senator’s health care proposals during the Democratic presidential primary.
Monday is the fifth anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act and,
while Republican Sen. Ted Cruz entered the presidential race vowing to repeal
the law, Clinton said she hopes to improve the law, not dismantle it.
The questions to ask are "how to improve the ACA...how to build on the
successes,” she said. “I’m well aware none of this will be easy,” she
continued, but it will be even more difficult without people like those in the
audience explaining the policies and personalities at play.
Clinton said the role of the press is to “hold us all accountable.” Still,
she said, "those of us on the other side are not always going to be happy
about what whatever it is you do but we understand in our more rational
moments."
