CFR Backgrounders: Al-Shabab
Introduction
Al-Shabab, or “the Youth,” is an al-Qaeda-linked militant group and
U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization fighting for the creation of a
fundamentalist Islamic state in Somalia. The group, also known as Harakat
al-Shabab al-Mujahideen, and its Islamist affiliates once held sway over
Mogadishu and major portions of the Somali countryside, but a sustained
African Union military campaign in recent years has weakened the group
considerably. Still, security analysts warn that the group remains the
principal threat in a politically volatile, war-torn state.
Al-Shabab's terrorist activities have mainly focused on targets within
Somalia, but it has also carried out deadly strikes in the region, including
coordinated suicide bombings in Uganda's capital in 2010 and a raid on a
Nairobi mall in 2013 (PDF). Washington fears the group, which has successfully
recruited members of the Somali diaspora in the United States, may strike on
U.S. soil. However, many terrorism experts say al-Shabab's reach is limited to
East Africa.
What are the origins of al-Shabab?
Somalia, one of the most impoverished countries in the world, has seen a
number of radical Islamist groups come and go in its decades-long political
upheaval. Analysts say the forerunner of al-Shabab, and the incubator for many
of its leaders, was Al-Ittihad Al-Islami (AIAI, or “Unity of Islam”), a
militant Salafi group that peaked in the 1990s after the fall of the Siad
Barre military regime (1969–1991) and the outbreak of civil war.
Washington fears the group, which has successfully recruited members of the
Somali diaspora in the United States, may strike on U.S. soil.
AIAI, which sought to establish an Islamist emirate in Somalia, sprang from a
band of Middle Eastern-educated Somali extremists and was partly funded and
armed by al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. Many of its fighters, including
current al-Shabab commanders, fled the country and fought in Afghanistan in
the late 1990s after being pushed out by the Ethiopian army and its Somali
supporters. The U.S. State Department designated the group a terrorist
organization in the days after the 9/11 attacks.
In 2003, a rift developed between AIAI's more moderate old guard, which had
decided to create a new political front, and younger members who sought the
establishment of a “Greater Somalia” under fundamental Islamic rule. The
hardliners eventually joined forces with an alliance of sharia courts, known
as the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), serving as its youth militia. Al-Shabab and
the ICU wrested control of the capital in June 2006, a victory that stoked
fears of spillover jihadist violence in neighboring Ethiopia, a majority
Christian nation.
What were the turning points for al-Shabab?
Ethiopia invaded Somalia in December 2006 and ousted the ICU from Mogadishu
with little resistance. The intervention, which came at the request of
Somalia's transitional government (which was set up in 2004), had a
radicalizing effect on al-Shabab, analysts say. After much of the ICU fled to
neighboring countries, al-Shabab remained and retreated to the south, where it
began organizing guerilla assaults, including bombings and assassinations, on
Ethiopian forces. Some experts say it was during these years that the group
morphed into a full-fledged guerilla movement and gained control over large
pieces of territory in central and southern Somalia.
The Ethiopian occupation (PDF) was responsible for “transforming the group
from a small, relatively unimportant part of a more moderate Islamic movement
into the most powerful and radical armed faction in the country,” writes Rob
Wise, a counterterrorism expert at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
Addis Ababa says the intervention was a “reluctant response“ to calls by
the ICU for jihad against Ethiopia and renewed territorial claims against both
Ethiopia and Kenya. It has stressed that the intervention was supported by the
United States and the African Union, among others.
New Islamist-nationalist fighters swelled al-Shabab's ranks from around four
hundred into the thousands between 2006 and 2008. This was also a period when
the group's ties to al-Qaeda began to emerge. Al-Shabab leaders publicly
praised the international terrorist network and condemned what they
characterized as U.S. crimes against Muslims worldwide. The State Department
designated al-Shabab a foreign terrorist organization in February 2008. Two
years later, the group vowed to “connect the horn of Africa jihad to the one
led by al-Qaeda and its leader Sheikh Osama bin Laden.” However, it was not
until February 2012 that al-Shabab's leadership formally declared allegiance
to al-Qaeda.
In June 2010, al-Shabab seemed to make good on its promises of jihad with
coordinated suicide bombings that killed seventy-four people who had gathered
to watch the World Cup in the Ugandan capital of Kampala. It was the group's
first terrorist attack outside of Somalia. “We are sending a message to
every country who is willing to send troops to Somalia that they will face
attacks on their territory,” said a spokesman at the time.
Uganda was the first nation to send forces into Somalia in March 2007 under
the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which was charged with
defending the transitional government. In late 2014, Kampala maintained the
largest contingent in the UN-backed force with 6,220 personnel. Other AMISOM
troops come from Burundi (5,338), Ethiopia (4,395), Kenya (3,664) Djibouti
(1,000), and Sierra Leone (800).
What are al-Shabab's objectives?
Many analysts say the group is not monolithic and its objectives vary. Writing
in 2012, former CFR fellow and Africa expert Bronwyn E. Bruton described some
of the cleavages that divide al-Shabab's leadership, including competing clan
loyalties and rifts between the group's nationalists intent on ousting AMISOM
and the central government, and Gulf-sponsored radicals with transnational
terror aims.
The group continues to threaten neighboring countries as well as Western
interests in Africa. In January 2013, Ethiopian authorities arrested more than
a dozen al-Shabab-linked militants allegedly plotting attacks in eastern
Ethiopia. And in September of that year, al-Shabab fighters claimed
responsibility for a raid on a Nairobi mall, holding hostages for days and
killing dozens. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Kenya since
al-Qaeda's East Africa affiliate bombed the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998
(224 people were killed  in that attack). Al-Shabab attacks in Kenya escalated
in 2014, with 173 people killed in Kenya, according to its police force.
In areas it controls, al-Shabab enforces its own harsh interpretation of
sharia, prohibiting various types of entertainment, such as movies and music,
the sale of khat (a narcotic plant often chewed), smoking, the shaving of
beards, and many other “un-Islamic” activities. Stonings and amputations
have been meted out as punishment on suspected adulterers and thieves.
International rights groups have reported that al-Shabab members have
kidnapped young boys from schools and have forced them to fight for the group.
Who are the group's leaders?
Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, who fought against Ethiopia as a colonel in the
Siad Biarre regime in the 1970s, is reportedly al-Shabab's spiritual leader.
He commanded the military arm of the AIAI, and then took over leadership of
the ICU. In 2006, Aweys handed operational command of al-Shabab to a young
Somali jihadi, Aden Hashi Ayro, who was killed in a U.S. missile strike in May
2008.
Ahmed Abdi Godane (aka Abu Zubayr), one of al-Shabab's founders, served as the
group's top commander after Ayro's death. He was designated a global terrorist
by the United States in November 2008.
In June 2013, Godane loyalists reportedly killed two senior al-Shabab leaders,
Ibrahim al-Afghani and Moalim Burhan, in a shoot-out that analysts attribute
to internal dissension. Prior to his death, al-Afghani reportedly penned a
letter to al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri condemning Godane's harsh
leadership style. That same month, Aweys, al-Shabab's elder statesman,
surrendered to federal authorities in Mogadishu after his relationship with
Godane soured.
In September 2014, the U.S. military confirmed it killed Godane in a targeted
air strike on an al-Shabab encampment in Somalia. The White House stated that
the successful counterterrorism operation marked “a major symbolic and
operational loss to the largest al-Qaida affiliate in Africa.” Some
terrorism experts believe the removal of al-Shabab's powerful, charismatic
leader will prompt a power struggle within the militant group.
Ahmed Umar, also known as Abu Ubaidah, is the current leader of al-Shabab.
Experts say he lacks the charisma and strategic intelligence of his
predecessor and is unlikely to maintain control of the fractious group.
Al-Shabab's former intelligence chief surrendered in late 2014, and the
militants continued to lose battles against African Union forces in 2015.
How is al-Shabab funded?
Counterterrorism experts say al-Shabab has benefited from several different
sources of income over the years, including revenue from other terrorist
groups, state sponsors, the Somali diaspora, charities, piracy, kidnapping,
and the extortion of local businesses. The governments of Eritrea, Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Syria, Qatar, and Yemen have been cited as financiers—although most
officially deny these claims.
Domestically, the group built up an extensive racketeering operation in
Kismayo after seizing control of the southern port city and its economy in
2008. The trade of charcoal, in particular, is essential to the city's
commerce. However, a Kenya-led assault on Kismayo liberated the port of
al-Shabab forces in October 2012—a victory that many experts say
strategically crippled the jihadi group.
However, an October 2014 UN Security Council report (PDF) says al-Shabab's
illicit charcoal trading hasn't been interrupted by “the military offensive
against the group” and continues in Kismayo and nearby Barawe. Charcoal
exports are a component of a trade that includes al-Shabab's importation of
sugar, much of which then makes its way into Kenya illegally. Roughly ten
thousand bags of contraband sugar worth hundreds of thousands of dollars may
be smuggled into Kenya every day, according to the UN. In April 2013, Kenyan
officials complained that al-Shabab operatives were attempting to infiltrate
the country's sugar trade.
What areas does al-Shabab control?
Despite strategic setbacks inflicted by AMISOM forces over the past several
years, including the loss of the Barawe in October 2014, al-Shabab remains in
control of most of southern and central Somalia. The U.S. State Department's
2013 terrorism report estimates the group has several thousand members.
Analysts say the group's resilience is likely the result of significant
support from local clans and the perception among elders that it remains a
plausible alternative to corrupt institutions in Mogadishu.
Does al-Shabab recruit U.S. nationals?
Al-Shabab has recruited members of the Somali-American diaspora in recent
years, a trend the FBI has described as a top domestic terrorist threat. In
particular, the group has attracted several volunteers from Minneapolis, MN,
which is home to the largest Somali population in the country. Shirwa Ahmed
and Farah Mohamad Beledi, the first two confirmed U.S. suicide bombers, both
traveled from Minnesota, where they had grown up, to Somalia to receive
al-Shabab training and wage jihad.
Another prominent leader for al-Shabab was Omar Hammami (aka Abu Mansoor
Al-Amriki), a native of Alabama, authorities say. However, Hammami reportedly
fell out with the group and was killed in a firefight with al-Shabab militants
in September 2013. Other Somali-American recruits have come from California,
New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Virginia, according to a list compiled by the
Anti-Defamation League.
What is U.S. policy in Somalia?
Washington's primary interest in Somalia has been preventing it from becoming
a refuge for terrorist groups like al-Shabab to plot attacks on the United
States and potentially destabilize the strategically significant Horn of
Africa, where longstanding disputes among  Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia
still fester. In recent years, U.S. officials have also been wary of
collaboration between the militant Islamist organizations in the region,
including al-Shabab, Boko Haram, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and al-Qaeda
in the Arabian Peninsula.
The United States, stung by the loss of eighteen U.S. servicemen in the Battle
of Mogadishu in 1993 (aka the “Black Hawk Down” incident), has largely
relied on the use of proxy forces in Somalia in recent years. Since 2007,
analysts say Washington has provided more than half a billion dollars to train
and equip African Union forces battling al-Shabab. Much of this indirect
logistical support has been supplied on the ground by State Department-funded
contractors, such as Bancroft Global Development and DynCorp.
Drone strikes and special operations raids on al-Shabab and al-Qaeda targets
have rounded out the U.S. strategy. Military analysts have characterized the
Pentagon's approach in Somalia as “offshore balancing,” which emphasizes
the use of U.S. air and sea assets in conjunction with support for local
counterinsurgency forces, such as AMISOM.
In January 2013, the United States formally recognized the Somali government
after a hiatus of more than twenty years, and two years later President Barack
Obama nominated Katherine Dhanani to be the first U.S. ambassador to Somalia
since 1991. And while the U.S. has no embassy in Mogadishu (the U.S. mission
to Somalia is based in the U.S. embassy in Nairobi), officials say Washington
is likely to expand its diplomatic presence.
