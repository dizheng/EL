Kenyan churches tighten security after Al-Shabaab kills 148 university students
Churches in Garissa town and its environs on Sunday tightened security
following a terrorist attack at Garissa University College on Thursday that
claimed 148 lives.
A spot check by Xinhua revealed that all the 36 churches in Garissa town
doubled the number of armed security officers from three to six.
The normally packed Christian churches experienced a low turnout on Sunday as
worshippers stayed at home due to security fears.
One of the largest churches in Garissa town, the East African Pentecostal
Church (EAPC), recorded a 50 percent drop in the number of worshippers.
The Church's priest, Ibrahim Makunyi told reporters his parishioners expressed
fear over a possible terrorist attack.
"We should not let fear overcome us and must unite as a people despite
religious differences to fight terrorism. There is no religion that support
killings," said Makunyi.
He survived a terrorist attack in 2012 and has championed for inter-religious
dialogue to fight this menace.
"Kenyans are worried by the wave of terror that has terminated the lives of
young and promising citizens. We need radical measures to prevent future
attacks," Makunyi remarked.
Christians residing in Garissa town kept a low profile on Sunday as they
discussed the aftermath of the worst terrorist attack in the region.
