Pope praises Iran nuclear deal in Easter message
VATICAN CITY: In an Easter peace wish, Pope Francis Sunday praised the
framework nuclear agreement with Iran as an opportunity to make the world
safer, while expressing deep worry about bloodshed in Libya, Yemen, Syria,
Iraq, Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa.
Cautious hope ran through Francis' "Urbi et Orbi" Easter message, a kind of
papal commentary on the state of the world's affairs, which he delivered from
the central balcony of St. Peter's Square.
He had just celebrated Mass in rain-whipped St. Peter's Square for tens of
thousands of people.
Francis made his first public comments about the recent framework for an
accord, reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, and aimed at ensuring Iran doesn't
develop a nuclear weapon.
"In hope we entrust to the merciful Lord the framework recently agreed to in
Lausanne, that it may be a definitive step toward a more secure and fraternal
world."
Decrying the plentitude of weapons in the world in general, Francis said: "And
we ask for peace for this world subjected to arms dealers, who earn their
living with the blood of men and women."
He denounced "absurd bloodshed and all barbarous acts of violence" in Libya,
convulsed by fighting fueled by tribal and militia rivalries. He hoped "a
common desire for peace" would prevail in Yemen, wracked by civil warfare.
Francis prayed that the "roar of arms may cease" in Syria and Iraq, and that
peace would come in Africa for Nigeria, South Sudan, Sudan and Congo.
He recalled the young people, many of them targeted because they were
Christians, killed last week in a Kenyan university, and lamented kidnappings,
by Islamic extremists, that have plagued parts of Africa, including Nigeria.
On Good Friday, Francis chastised the international community for what he
called the complicit silence about the killing of Christians. On Easter he
prayed that God would alleviate "the suffering of so many of our brothers
persecuted because of his name."
During Mass, Francis was shielded from pelting rain by a canopy erected
outside St. Peter's Basilica, while prelates carried umbrellas in the yellow
and white colors of the Vatican.
The downpour petered out to a drizzle, and by the ceremony, the rain had
stopped. Francis, wearing a white overcoat, was driven through the square in
the open-sided popemobile so he could wave to the faithful.
