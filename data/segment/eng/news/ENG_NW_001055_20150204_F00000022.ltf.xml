Evidence Surfaces That Chris Kyle's Killer Was Not Suffering From PTSD But May Have Been A Terrorist Sympathizer
"No combat experience. Let me say that again, he NEVER SAW COMBAT or any
aspect of traumatic events associated with a combat deployment."
With his trial to start very soon, new facts have surfaced surrounding the man
who shot and killed Chris Kyle.
The narrative until now has stated that Eddie Ray Routh was suffering from
PTSD when Kyle took him under his wing, attempting to help a fellow veteran in
need.  The new facts coming to light could show that Routh was not suffering
from PTSD but a converted Muslim who sought out Kyle as retribution for the
sniper's success in Iraq.
Through the Freedom of Information Act, The Warfighter Foundation received
Routh’s wartime record and made a startling discovery – Routh was never in
combat or in any sort of traumatic experience.
Posted to their Facebook page, they write:
Eddie Routh served one tour in Iraq in 2007, at Balad Air Base (the 2nd
largest U.S. installation in Iraq), with no significant events. No combat
experience. Let me say that again, he NEVER SAW COMBAT or any aspect of
traumatic events associated with a combat deployment (i.e. incoming mortar or
rocket fire). He never left the base, EVER.
He held a non-combat arms occupation of 2111 (Small Arms Repairer/ Technician
or more commonly referred to as an Armorer). Balad Air Base had a Pizza Hut,
24 hour Buger King, Subway, Popeye's, Baskin Robbins, movie theater, and even
a miniature golf course. It even had a strictly enforced 10-mile per hour
speed limit! What a dangerous place...
His tour was comparable to being on a base in southern California, only with
MANY more luxuries that were catered to the morale and welfare of the troops
who occupied it. He was known to be a drug user and a below average performer
while in the Marine Corps.
This has NOTHING to do with PTSD. He was an individual with psychological
problems that were not associated with his service. So don't give me that
bleeding heart bullshit that he was a veteran suffering from PTSD.
What is known. however, is that Routh, while never serving in combat, did work
at the Bilad Airbase prison, guarding Muslim terrorists.
Walid Shoebat, a former radicalized Muslim terrorist and member of the PLO who
has since converted to Christianity, believes that because of his past and
credentials, he is confident in his deduction that Eddie Routh was in fact
becoming a radical Muslim, although there is no proof yet of the conversion.
Shoebat brings as one proof a phone call Routh had with his father where he
expressed sympathy for the detainees he was guarding.
“During a phone call with his father, Routh expressed sympathy for the
detainees and discontent over how the US was conducting the war as well as his
reluctance to engage in combat” and “While working as a guard at Balad Air
Base, Routh laments his [Muslim] prisoners’ poor living conditions.”
He continues, “It is a known fact that Routh’s family contacted Kyle about
their son’s diminishing mental health. Routh was admitted to inpatient
psychiatric treatment prior to the events at Rough Creek Ranch, according to a
report from the Daily Mail.  Routh had been taken to a mental hospital twice
in the past five months and told authorities that he was suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder, police records show.”
The second proof Shoebat brings is Routh's beard with a trimmed mustache. 
Shoebat profiles Routh and writes, “In the story on Eddie Routh, who
murdered Chris Kyle, there are signs of concern, especially the facial hair,
it does match the profile of a convert.”
Notice the trimmed mustache in one picture but not the other.
“One main key in profiling a Muslim fundamentalist is that they usually trim
the mustache,” Shoebat writes.  “Always remember, a Muslim fundamentalist
is mandated by Islam to trim the mustache,” he adds.
Is it a stretch?  Was Eddie Routh sent on a covert mission for extremist
Muslims hell-bent on killing “The Devil of Ramadi?”  It will be
interesting to watch as the trial unfolds and more information comes out if
Kyle’s killer was suffering from PTSD or if he had ties to Muslim
extremists.
