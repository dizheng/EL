What Netanyahu’s Victory Means for America
The American political class has spent decades convincing itself that the
Israeli political class really does want a two-state solution to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The last six years have been the
hardest—Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proclaimed a tepid desire
for peace, but consistently acted contrary it—and yet the image of an Israel
that would strike the deal if only this or that condition was met by the
Palestinians persisted. Perhaps the image even grew stronger: who can forget
all the standing ovations Netanyahu received during his 2009 address to
Congress and, despite all the controversy, again this winter?
The illusion, however, of an Israeli body politic, perhaps even an Israeli
electorate, happy to make peace was shattered as Netanyahu sailed to another
victory—especially in light of the way he did it. Netanyahu’s last minute
bid to strengthen his hand came not from fear-mongering about Iran, as he’d
done for years, but about the Palestinians. His fired salvos at both
Palestinian citizens of Israel (some 20 percent of the population) and against
those Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. In the former case, Netanyahu
warned his base Arabs were “coming out in droves to the polls”; in the
latter, he boldly declared that no Palestinian state would be birthed were he
elected (something Netanyahu had been hinting at throughout the campaign).
The mantra of American Israel supporters, from grassroots lobby groups right
up to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., has always been that the United States and
Israel hold “shared values”—chief among them the countries’ common
democratic characters. But Netanyahu’s campaign put the lie to the notion.
“Remember that Netanyahu’s version of democracy includes as few Arab
voices as possible, simply because they are not Jewish,” wrote +972
Magazine’s Michael Schaeffer Omer-Man. “Remember that the peace processes
he has overseen for decades were not genuine, that he never had any intention
of ushering in, let alone seeking, a two-state solution.”
