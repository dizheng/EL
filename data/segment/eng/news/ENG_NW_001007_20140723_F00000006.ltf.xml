Hillary for Liberals: A Conversation With Walter Shapiro
"As a campaigner, Hillary can do a shot and a beer better than Barack Obama
can," Shapiro says. So there's that.
As a reporter and columnist for Time, Newsweek, the Washington Post, USA
Today, Esquire, Salon, and other publications, Walter Shapiro has covered nine
presidential elections and the nation’s politics for four decades. He is
currently a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University
and a lecturer in political science at Yale while he finishes a book about his
great-uncle, a vaudevillian and con man who once swindled Hitler.
Shapiro is also an accomplished Hillary-ologist, having first interviewed
Hillary Clinton in the Arkansas governor’s mansion for Time in September
1992. In early May, Shapiro sat down with Prospect editor-at-large Harold
Meyerson to talk about a question he’s internally debated for years: On
balance, would a Hillary Clinton candidacy and presidency be a good or bad
thing for the liberal cause?
The following discussion has been edited for concision and clarity.
Harold Meyerson: Walter, when liberals look at Hillary Clinton, what should
they see? The Democratic Party and the country have certainly changed since
she was first lady, and even since she was a senator and secretary of state.
Walter Shapiro: I’ve always thought that Bill Clinton was never really a
person of the ’60s. Bill Clinton started in 1960 as a 14-year-old who wanted
to be governor of Arkansas. He came out of the ’60s as a 24-year-old who
wanted to be governor of Arkansas without going to Vietnam. But Hillary did
the full, life-changing conversion from the obedient Goldwater Girl to
delivering an ethereal but genuinely anti-war address at Wellesley in ’69.
So in a sense, as far as the culture of the time washing over someone, it
washed over her more than it ever washed over Bill.
HM: Still, she spent so many years in Arkansas, and Arkansas’s political
culture is not one with which most liberals are comfortable. Both Clintons
were clearly supportive of the civil-rights revolution. But the other part of
that culture is the Stephens investment firm and Wal-Mart, and to get
somewhere in Arkansas politics, you eventually have relations with them.
Hillary famously was on the Wal-Mart board for a while.
WS: What stayed with me, and I still think it’s really important for
understanding Hillary, happened in March of 1992, at a debate before the
Illinois primary. Jerry Brown (Bill Clinton’s primary opponent) went after
Bill Clinton in part for the legal work that Hillary did at Rose Law Firm on
behalf of banks. And Hillary at some point said, in effect, “Of course I
work for banks; who do you expect me to work for if I’m a lawyer?” Well,
there were, believe it or not, other clients in the state of Arkansas in the
1980s while her husband was governor.
HM: That’s no small part of what gives liberals pause about Hillary—who
is, of course, still going around giving talks to the Goldman Sachses of the
world. Is she too inextricably linked to that world? One of the major issues
liberals had with Obama is that his economic team has been, like Bill
Clinton’s, primarily Robert Rubin protégés. That’s two straight
Democratic presidencies with a Wall Street pedigree.
WS: As a campaigner, Hillary can do a shot and a beer better than Barack Obama
can. She was an exceedingly good candidate when it was too late in the ’08
primaries with white working-class voters in Pennsylvania, in Indiana, in
states like that. That said, everything in the ledger says she’s not a
policy populist.
Remember that the Bill Clinton administration at its most successful was the
Democratic answer to Reaganism. It was what the French call “the spirit of
the staircase”—coming up with everything you should have said at the party
just after you’ve left it. The administration said, let’s get off the
table everything Reagan criticized about the Democrats. It was welfare, so
they ended it; it was crime, so they came up with funding for 100,000 more
cops; it was economic deficits, so they came up with a balanced budget.
To some extent, electing Hillary Clinton in 2016 could continue a debate with
Ronald Reagan that no one else in American life is still having. The Democrats
have mostly forgotten Reagan, and the Republicans have turned him into this
sainted soul of political constancy. But a Hillary presidency would be still
framed by the Democratic memory of those horrible years in the wilderness in
the 1980s, when the Democrats got wiped out in three successive elections.
HM: But the political landscape, the demographic profile of voters has changed
so much since then. More political space has opened up on the left; the nation
has plainly moved in a liberal direction on social issues; there are very few
Blue Dogs remaining. Is this defensive crouch against the Republicans a
politically viable stance?
WS: I’m talking about what makes her tick. Of course, she won two elections
in a very diverse state since Bill’s presidency, and she won an awful lot of
presidential primaries in ’08. She understands the diversity of America in
2017—except in the economic sense.
That said, I don’t think she’s the candidate of Archie Bunker’s America.
But the worst thing that could have happened to her in terms of framing any
economic populist message was to run for the Senate from New York rather than,
say, Arkansas. Not only do the Clintons have a certain psychological need for
money—that would probably be a separate course in the Department of Hillary
Studies—but her constituents were Wall Street, and they were also the people
who were funding all the Clinton initiatives and giving speaking fees to Bill.
Ultimately she has an orthodox, mainstream, centrist, Eisenhower Republican
view of the economy. It is much to the left of today’s Republican Party
since there are no Eisenhower Republicans left, but it is also much less in
keeping with large segments of the Democratic Party. I can see her being very
involved in raising the minimum wage, because it’s not as if hedge-fund
billionaires are on the barricades against it. But trying to do a better,
tougher version of Dodd-Frank? Let’s merely say that the polls would have to
get very dismal for Hillary leading up to the 2020 election for that to even
be on her agenda.
HM: Let’s go to foreign policy.
WS: If you wanted me to state my own personal reservations about Hillary, I
would have started with foreign policy.
HM: What would those reservations be?
WS: First of all, other than the anti-war feeling, which is more generational
than an elaborate, nuanced foreign-policy view, I don’t think she had
terribly developed foreign-policy views during Bill’s presidency. OK, there
was the general, and to my mind, admirable tilt toward humanitarian
intervention in both Haiti and, much more important, in Bosnia. I do not think
she would have dithered the way Obama has on Syria.
That said, I’ve seen no evidence that she had too much anguish over her vote
to authorize Bush to go to war in Iraq. John Kerry turned himself into
elaborate pretzel positions to try to justify that vote. Hillary may have
anguished about many things, but that does not seem to be in the Top 10
Hillary Anguish moments.
HM: What do you think her hawkishness on Iraq would portend for foreign policy
if Hillary were president?
WS: While she is not a Dick Cheney groupie, in a situation where there is a
range of military actions on the table and there’s a responsible, mainstream
opinion within the administration toward using the military—and the
foreign-policy community says military action is called for—she would
probably go with it and cheerlead it on. I don’t think she’s going to
invent a war with Mongolia out of some crazed geopolitical effort to encircle
China. But hers would probably be a more hawkish administration than we have
now with Obama and John Kerry.
I’m much less worried about her starting a war with Denmark, though, than I
am by the fact that she is probably the Democratic presidential candidate who
would do the least to rein in the National Security Agency and all the
leftover aspects of the “war on terror.” Sadly, both Hillary and Bill know
that civil liberties is that which closes on Saturday night.
HM: Bill Clinton was not famed for his managerial prowess and neither is
Barack Obama. That’s certainly part of the president’s job. Is Hillary a
better manager than Bill?
WS: I think she is much more than just that. If you have been through a
disaster like the first two years of the Clinton administration, you know what
to do now. Flash forward to a White House in 2017. First, Bill and Hillary
will have worked out their marriage, with her 69 and him 70, as well as any
couple is likely to. If ever there’s a marriage that by 2017 has few
surprises, it’s probably that one. Second, Hillary has been through two
disastrous, disorganized White Houses under Bill Clinton and Obama. The way
Obamacare was handled, in that the entire story of health care got lost, also
the failure to put enough emphasis on the economy after the stimulus
passed—all these things Hillary saw. She would come into the White House
with a greater understanding of White House dysfunction than anyone in
Democratic Party history. To have been in the Obama cabinet would also steel
you against creating a White House where people believe they’ve invented the
wheel, that they’re geniuses—the problems that have afflicted this White
House.
HM: Bill is clearly going to be her chief adviser. How does this factor into
everything?
WS: It will cause certain lines-of-authority confusion in the White House. But
ultimately, I think it’s more good than bad. Every president, from what
I’ve read and seen, communes with the ghosts of presidents past. It’s sort
of nice to have a ghost of presidents past available on call. There will come
a point if Hillary is president in, say, 2019, that something happens that
already happened somewhere, sometime during Bill Clinton’s eight years in
the White House. It would be really good to have the lessons from that
analogue on tap.
HM: Right now, there’s no one else in the Democratic Party who’s within 40
or 50 points of Hillary in presidential polling. How do you assess her
strengths and weaknesses as a candidate? A lot of what you’re describing is
not necessarily the stuff that resonates with younger voters, except possibly
that her election would be historic.
WS: There is an iron law of campaign journalism: Never assume anything with
absolute certainty in presidential politics, because there are always
surprises. President Muskie would be the first to remind us. That said, I had
drinks last night with two prominent Republican consultants. What they told me
is that they believe that Hillary—running as a centrist, not a populist, and
moderately hawkish—would just sweep the field. There is no Republican who
could possibly beat her except in exceptional circumstances. Part of it is the
history-making nature of the race. But it is also this: All the things that
make liberals a little uneasy about a Hillary presidency are the things that
are perfect for a general election against a fill-in-the-blank Republican. Of
course, in the remote chance that Rand Paul got the nomination, it would be
interesting to see a Republican running against a Democrat with the Republican
running to the left on national security.
But the larger point—and it’s one of the reasons, after going back and
forth within myself, I am more in favor of her running than not—is that
American politics since the 2000 election has been balanced on a knife’s
edge. While there are moments when one party surges ahead, pretty much the
country has been in equal balance. Beyond 2000, had just 130,000 votes been
different in Ohio in 2004, John Kerry would have been president even though he
would have lost the popular vote. Mitt Romney, not exactly someone who is
going down in the Candidate Hall of Fame, still got, what, 47 percent of the
vote?
HM: That was the appropriate percentage for him.
WS: The point is that Hillary could win a resounding victory that could bring
in a Democratic majority to govern. And I would much rather have a president
with a majority to govern, even if the decisions she made were not always
decisions I agreed with, than another eight years, or four years, of a
Democrat hamstrung by a divided Congress.
HM: Why don’t we hear more of an outcry from the left of the party for an
alternative to Hillary?
WS: Three reasons come to mind. For some, it’s that electing a woman
president would be historic. For others, there is the depressed sense of
dashed expectations after five years of Obama. But the biggest reason, I
suspect, is the political truism: “You can’t beat somebody with nobody.”
And despite Elizabeth Warren fantasies, the Democratic left doesn’t have
anyone who looks like a plausible president now willing to run.
That doesn’t mean that Hillary will run unopposed. Maybe it will be former
Governor Brian Schweitzer of Montana. Maybe it’ll be Howard Dean—or
Senator Bernie Sanders, to keep coming up with Vermonters. I went back and
checked since World War II. Aside from incumbent presidents, no one has ever
been handed a presidential nomination unopposed other than Richard Nixon in
1960. And even Nixon had to kiss the hem of Nelson Rockefeller’s garment
with something called the Compact of Fifth Avenue.
HM: Can Hillary turn out young people like Obama did—a key to both his
victories? Can she engender a remotely comparable excitement factor?
WS: No. But probably neither can any other Democrat. Obama leached the sense
of political excitement out of an entire generation with the gap between his
campaign style and his governing style.
Also, remember that young voters in 2016 will have different life experiences
than young voters in 2008. A 21-year-old in 2016 will have been in first grade
on 9/11 and was too young at the time to understand the lies that sent us to
war with Iraq. That means that these 2016 voters—no matter the
candidates—will react to different stimuli than young voters in 2008.
So how can Hillary win in 2016? Maybe by sparking greater enthusiasm from
women—especially single women. Maybe a 54-year-old waitress in Waterloo,
Iowa, will vote for the first time. Hillary might also change the political
map by running competitively in states like Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana,
and Arkansas.
HM: How would a primary challenge from someone like Warren affect Hillary’s
campaign? In terms of constituencies, I can see the party
establishment—unions, electeds, blacks, traditional donors—sticking with
her. But could that “Mondale-ize” her? And could Warren muster the kind of
support that Gary Hart did in his 1984 challenge to Mondale?
WS: My heart goes pitter-patter whenever I get a Walter Mondale question.
Which, oddly enough, happens less and less these days. But Mondale-Hart in
’84 is one of those races that explains the Democratic Party, along with
Carter-Kennedy in 1980 and Bobby Kennedy versus Gene McCarthy in 1968.
I’d be stunned beyond belief if Elizabeth Warren ran against Hillary. Of
course, I never expected Spiro Agnew, Dan Quayle, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus to
be vice presidents of the United States. The Hart challenge to Mondale, which
was based on amorphous “new ideas,” was in hindsight a generational
battle. Elizabeth Warren is only two years younger than Hillary.
There has to be an issue with a passionate following to sustain a major
primary challenge to Hillary. Right now, the Democrats don’t have one. For a
project at Brookings, I’ve been watching what’s being stressed in
Democratic House primaries around the country. At this point, NSA spying and
drone attacks are just not voting issues for liberals. Getting tough with Wall
Street—like single-payer health insurance—was something much more likely
to trigger an adrenaline rush for the left in 2009 than in 2016.
HM: But Walter, a lot of recent polling done for Democrats shows that there is
a sizable constituency that believes the economy is rigged; that the rich get
away with low taxes while the middle class can’t; that free trade with other
nations has damaged our economy; that when a candidate says he or she sides
against Wall Street and with workers, they have more of a claim on this
constituency’s support. Don’t you think there’s real political space for
a candidate who positions herself or himself to Hillary’s left on these
issues?
WS: Polls, schmolls. Which should be a Yiddish word meaning “enough with the
cross-tabs.”
I agree that there’s space on the left. But that’s a lot different than
having a charismatic candidate capable of exploiting it. What’s needed to
run against Hillary is more than just the ability to play to the choir by
mouthing off on MSNBC. That’s the campaign of Dennis Kucinich redux.
The more that we talk about this, the more I wish that Paul Wellstone were
still alive. I don’t see anyone of his liberal stature—anyone with his
sense of fun—willing to take on Hillary. It would take an exceptional
candidate to harvest that underlying unease with a Clinton restoration. But
it’s 18 months until Iowa and, boy, have I been wrong before.
For Hillary, a challenge from the left—as long as it didn’t catch
fire—would actually help set her up for the general election since it would
send the message that she was more of a centrist than a Karl Rove caricature.
I also suspect it would be easier for Hillary to co-opt a primary challenge by
making the right dovish noises on foreign policy or NSA eavesdropping than by
attacking Wall Street, which would be for her an Olympic-level gymnastic
trick. But, then, we’ve already seen Bill Clinton’s Dick Morris–inspired
triangulation for the 1996 campaign. So maybe I shouldn’t dismiss
Hillary’s malleability on economic issues if that was what was needed to win
the nomination. But I wouldn’t count on follow-through if she got to the
White House.
