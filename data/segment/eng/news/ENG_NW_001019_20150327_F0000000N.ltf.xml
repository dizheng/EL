Kerry calls Netanyahu amid intense nuclear negotiations with Iran
Iranian official says progress being made; U.S. in message to Iran: Time has
come to make tough decisions.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday called Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to update Israel on the progress of the intense nuclear negotiations
underway in Lausanne, Switzerland, a senior U.S. official told Haaretz.
This is the second time Kerry has updated Netanyahu on the talks between world
powers and Iran over its nuclear program in the last two days, the official
said, after also calling Netanyahu on Thursday.
Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met twice on Friday.
Every meeting lasted for a few hours, as the negotiation teams of the six
world powers and Iran were also convening.
The foreign ministers of the other five powers, which include Russia, France,
Britain, Germany and China, are expected to arrive to Lausanne on Saturday.
The EU's foreign policy chief, Federika Mogherini, will join them on Sunday.
Senior negotiators in the Iranian team stated that progress is being made, and
added that all sides hope to bridge the gaps by Sunday.
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Hamid Baidinejad on Friday mentioned two
issues still under dispute: the matter of limits on Iranian research and
development and the lifting of the sanction imposed on Iran.
Earlier, a senior U.S. official said that the talks have been "tough and very
serious" and the next few days will show whether Tehran is ready to make the
necessary hard decisions.
"Weâ€™re at that point in the negotiations where we really need to see
decisions being made," the senior State Department official said on condition
of anonymity. "We will test whether that is truly possible over the next
several days."
All sides to the Iran nuclear negotiations expressed optimism on Thursday
night that an agreement could be reached in the days remaining until the end
of March.
