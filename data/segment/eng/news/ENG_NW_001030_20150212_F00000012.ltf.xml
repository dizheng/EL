Bradley Cooper on 'American Sniper': Chris Kyle 'didn't really leave me'
"You've got your back to the window, so you're kind of screwed," Bradley
Cooper said.
Cooper was scanning the room from a high-backed chair, his eyes tracking the
waiter carrying his breakfast, the guy in the hoodie tapping away on a laptop
near the door, the "at risk" reporter staring back at him.
Assessing the potential threats in a space — even in a Tribeca luxury hotel
on a sleepy December morning with horizontal rain — was a habit Cooper had
picked up while making "American Sniper."
"After that, you're more aware of everything," he said of the experience of
crawling inside the mind of the military's deadliest sniper, Chris Kyle. "He
didn't really leave me."
The role became imprinted on Cooper in other ways: He gained 30 pounds of
muscle, perfected a West Texas twang and learned how to shoot a .300
Winchester Magnum rifle. He also delivered a rugged type of screen stoicism
that his "American Sniper" director, Clint Eastwood, made a career of.
For the effort, Cooper, 40, has earned his third Oscar nomination in as many
years, after the David O. Russell films "Silver Linings Playbook" and
"American Hustle," a feat only nine other actors have achieved.
And the movie, a best picture nominee that Cooper produced and championed
despite others' doubts about its marketability, has become a box office
phenomenon, earning more than $250 million domestically. Along the way, it has
also ignited political debate about the Iraq war and the toll on the people
who fought it.
The success for "Sniper" comes at a time when Cooper is performing on Broadway
in "The Elephant Man" as a very different sort of man, John Merrick, the
deformed Englishman who became a celebrity in 19th century London society.
Cooper plays the role without the use of prosthetics, contorting his arm and
face and speaking in a labored, high-pitched voice.
"As an actor, [Chris Kyle and John Merrick] were both very similar in terms of
what I had to do physically," Cooper said, "the fact that I had to change my
body chemistry, the physicality as an entranceway into the roles. Both of
them, oddly enough, were also very clear as to who they were. Both men felt
very planted in the ground."
Late last year, as "The Elephant Man" had opened to rapturous reviews and
"American Sniper" was yet to arrive in theaters, Cooper talked about how the
two roles were a culmination of an interest that was sparked when he was 12,
growing up in a Philadelphia suburb.
It was then that Cooper saw David Lynch's 1980 version of "The Elephant Man,"
starring John Hurt as Merrick.
"It crushed me," Cooper said of the Lynch film. "I just felt this real
emotional reaction to Merrick's plight, to how he was able to be so positive
and joyful, and saw the goodness in stuff when he was afflicted with this
disorder."
At the time, Cooper's family said, "'Oh, Brad wants to be an actor. How cute.
Go eat some ravioli,'" he said.
But after getting a bachelor's in English at Georgetown University, Cooper
studied at the Actors Studio Drama School in New York, home of the James
Lipton-hosted "Inside the Actors Studio." In a 1999 episode of the Bravo show,
an earnest, shaggy-haired Cooper asks guest Sean Penn a question from the
audience.
Cooper found early work in television, on series "Alias" and "Jack &amp; Bobby,"
and in film comedies "Wet Hot American Summer" and "The Wedding Crashers"
before his breakout role as a playboy ringleader in the "Hangover" films
helped transform him into a box office commodity and a People magazine
"sexiest man alive."
After he played a man with bipolar disorder in "Silver Linings Playbook,"
Cooper learned about Kyle's story from a friend, screenwriter Jason Hall, and
came aboard the project as a producer before ultimately agreeing to star to
get a studio interested. Cooper never met Kyle. He was killed at a shooting
range while helping a veteran on Feb. 2, 2013, just one day after Hall turned
in his first draft of "American Sniper."
The project cycled through multiple possible directors, including Steven
Spielberg, before Eastwood came aboard in the summer of 2013.
As a producer, Cooper was heavily involved, both in the planning and the
editing room, according to Eastwood.
"Bradley was engaged in all aspects of the film and has an unparalleled work
ethic and concentration level," Eastwood said. "He was very invested in the
overall project, as I was when I was young. Being interested in every detail
is what drove me to want to direct, and I would not be surprised to see
Bradley wanting to direct in the future." (In fact, Cooper has expressed an
interest in directing a dramatic comedy by "Crazy, Stupid, Love" writer Dan
Fogelman.)
Critics have praised Cooper's performance for its naturalism and for
humanizing a closely guarded character.
"Bradley's basically playing a guy who does not reveal his emotions,"
"American Sniper" producer Rob Laurenz said. "Emotion is how you connect with
an audience, so to not be able to express it in a big way is hard. You rely on
subtleties in the eyes and in the face. It's a wildly challenging role."
Cooper said he knew he was taking a risk by playing Kyle, a man so different
from him in background, physicality and bearing, and a political lightning rod
to boot.
"I knew I could get crushed for doing this role, but at least I know why I'm
doing it," Cooper said. "It's so clear to me. I love Chris. That's all I had
to work with. Forget everything else. That's a huge anchor, you hold on to
that."
Living in New York for the play, he said he still takes the subway and often
walks past his old apartment on Barrow Street in the West Village.
Next he plans to bring "The Elephant Man" to London and reteam with Russell on
a project with his "Silver Linings Playbook" costar Jennifer Lawrence.
"I get to go to work every day and do something I love to death ... and have
people react in a way that I would want them to, that they're affected by it,"
Cooper said. "That's it, dude. That's why I'm an actor."
