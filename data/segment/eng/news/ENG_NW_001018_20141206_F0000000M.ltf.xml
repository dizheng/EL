HINDOCHA AND STEENKAMP FAMILIES UNITE
The parents of slain model Reeva Steenkamp and honeymoon bride Anni Dewani
were uniting in their grief, the Saturday Star reported.
"I'm delighted that Reeva's parents have said they will support us and am very
grateful for that," Anni's father, Vinod Hindocha, told the newspaper.
"Mr Steenkamp and I talked about Reeva and Anni and I gave him my sympathy
too. Only he and I as fathers can properly understand the pain of losing a
daughter to bullets and then experience very difficult and high-profile
cases."
The Steenkamps and Hindochas were supporting each other in calling for justice
in both cases.
The Steenkamps have backed calls by the Hindocha family for Anni's husband,
Shrien Dewani, to give evidence about her murder.
Shrien Dewani was allegedly the mastermind behind a staged hijacking that led
to his bride's death in Cape Town in 2010.
Anni was killed by a single bullet to the neck. Steenkamp was shot dead by her
boyfriend, paralympian Oscar Pistorius on Valentine's Day last year. He
claimed to have mistaken her for an intruder.
The Western Cape High Court would on Monday rule on whether the case against
Dewani should be dismissed.
Meanwhile, the High Court in Pretoria would on Tuesday hear the request to
appeal Pistorius's conviction and sentence.
He is serving a five-year sentence following his culpable homicide conviction.
