Comedian Jay Leno Makes Comeback in Israel for Award Show
Jay Leno is making a comeback — in Israel.
The late-night legend says he will return to Israel in June to host the award
ceremony for the second annual "Genesis Prize." Leno also hosted the inaugural
ceremony last year for what is billed as "the Jewish Nobel Prize." The $1
million prize is being awarded to Oscar-winning actor Michael Douglas in
recognition of his "passion" for his Jewish heritage and Israel.
Leno said he was thrilled to be invited back, comparing the warm welcome he
received last year to a raucous Italian wedding.
"People seem to be genuinely happy to see you," he told The Associated Press.
"There you kind of get swarmed. People run over, and the grandmas pinch your
cheeks. So that was kind of fun."
He said he felt that people seemed especially appreciative of his decision to
visit at a time when entertainers are under pressure to boycott Israel over
its policies toward the Palestinians. "Israelis are thrilled when you actually
show up," he said.
Leno, who is not Jewish, described himself as a big supporter of Israel, and
said he disagreed with critics who portray the country as an aggressor.
"It seems like they [Israel] have the worst PR in the world," he said. "I
don't understand how Israel is the bad guy here. It doesn't make any sense to
me."
The Genesis Prize Foundation said the June 18 ceremony will include a tribute
to Douglas, a celebration of the contribution of Jews to Hollywood and
Broadway and a segment on diversity and tolerance. Douglas, whose father,
actor Kirk Douglas, is Jewish, has said he will donate his prize money to
projects that promote inclusiveness in the Jewish community.
"Michael Douglas has chosen to invest the prize award into initiatives which
will resonate with Jews like himself — those who come from parents of mixed
heritage who wish to be part of the Jewish community," said Stan Polovets,
co-founder and chairman of the foundation.
Leno said he is already gathering material to make fun of Douglas, a longtime
acquaintance, as well as the country's politicians. Hundreds of VIPs,
including the prime minister, are expected to attend.
"After 22 years of hearing Jay poke fun of my movies on 'The Tonight Show,'
it'll be a nice change to be there when he does it in person," Douglas said in
a statement released by the foundation.
One person who does not have to worry is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
wife, Sara. Often portrayed as petty and demanding by Israeli comedians, Mrs.
Netanyahu will be off limits, Leno said.
"I tend to use the mafia model," he said. "You don't go after the wives and
children."
The Genesis Prize was founded by the prime minister's office, the Jewish
Agency and the Genesis Philanthropy Group, a nonprofit organization that
promotes Jewish education for Russian-speaking Jews worldwide. Last year's
recipient was Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire philanthropist and former
mayor of New York.
