New papers reveal lawsuit between Sara Netanyahu, brother
PM’s wife was sued for withdrawing NIS 60,000 from deceased father’s
account to pay for headstone, death announcements
Sara Netanyahu’s brother sued her in 2012 for withdrawing and using money
from her deceased father’s account without approval from other members of
her family, documents cleared for publication Thursday showed.
According to the report released by the family court of Jerusalem, after her
father, the Israeli poet and educator Shmuel Ben-Artzi, died in November 2011,
Netanyahu, wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, took out nearly NIS
60,000 from her father’s Bank Hapoalim account.
However, her brother, Hagai Ben-Artzi, disputed the use of the money.
The report comes after weeks in which Sara Netanyahu has been pilloried in the
press amid claims of excessive spending and an abuse lawsuit filed by a former
caretaker of the Prime Minister’s Residence.
According to court documents, Netanyahu took out the NIS 60,000 “despite the
fact that at the time they had yet to receive a probate order and that
Ben-Artzi had even told the bank of his objection to the payment.”
The money was used to pay for a headstone and death announcements in Israeli
newspapers, but Hagai Ben-Artzi, a Jewish philosophy professor, claimed that
decision should have received his approval, as another recipient of the will.
According to the bank, which appeared with Netanyahu in the suit, only one
beneficiary is needed to withdraw funds from a deceased persons account.
Sara Netanyahu and her brother ultimately decided on March 12, 2014 to settle
the matter out of court.
