Carl Pistorius, brother of jailed Paralympian Oscar, to be charged over motorway crash
Mr Pistorius was left in intensive car after the head-on accident, which
happened on one of the country’s main motorways towards the end of his
brother’s trial for killing Reeva Steenkamp
Carl Pistorius, the brother of the athlete Oscar Pistorius who was jailed last
year for killing girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, is to be charged with reckless
and negligent driving.
South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority confirmed it had served a
summons on Mr Pistorius to appear before a court to face the charge in the
coming weeks.
He is to be charged after a motorway car crash in August which left him in
intensive care.
Mr Pistorius was trapped in his car and suffered several ruptured organs as
well as severe leg injuries after the head-on collision at around 8pm on
Friday August 1 last year. He attended his brother’s high-profile trial in
Pretoria in a wheelchair and leg braces.
The crash was the second in which Mr Pistorius has been involved and for which
he has faced charges. In May last year, he was acquitted of a culpable
homicide charge over the death of a motorcyclist.
The latest crash involved two cars, Mr Pistorius’s Toyota Corolla and the
other driver’s Hyundai, and happened on the N1 motorway around two hours
north of Pretoria as he drove home from a business meeting.
Mr Pistorius’s family said it was caused by the other motorist, who was
stuck in traffic in the opposite lane, pulling out in front of him.
The South African Police Service and the National Prosecuting Authority this
week announced that Mr Pistorius, but not the other motorist, would be charged
with reckless and negligent driving.
Colonel Ronel Otto, of the SAPS Limpopo, said Mr Pistorius had ignored several
attempts by the investigating officer to take his statement about what
happened.
“One of the biggest reasons he is being charged is because he failed to
co-operate with the police investigation,” she said.
Nathi Mncube, spokesman for South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority
denied this was the case.
“He has the right to remain silent, there must be evidence to bring such a
charge,” he said.
He rejected suggestions on social media that South Africa’s prosecuting
authority – which has appealed against a judge’s decision not to convict
Oscar Pistorius for murdering Miss Steenkamp – was pursuing a “vendetta”
against the family.
