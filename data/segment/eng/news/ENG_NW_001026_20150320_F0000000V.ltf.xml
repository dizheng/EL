Public goofus Hillary vs. private gallant Hillary
I’m calling bullsh** on the media’s portrayal of Hillary Clinton.
“The private Hillary is as warm and charming a woman as anyone could conjure
up. The public Hillary sometimes seems brittle, with the judgment of a raging
rhinoceros,” writes fellow syndicated columnist Ann McFeatters.
I don’t mean to pick on McFeatters. Everyone (in the media) says the same
thing: Hillary Clinton is so awesome one-on-one or maybe one-on-six, in
private. For example, Mark Leibovich says she is “quite human and funny”
in private.
She’s been a high-profile national politician for more than 20 years. Why
hasn’t she figured out how to charm the American public on TV?
These repeated accounts of Hillarity are less than reliable, issued as they
are by the kind of people in a position to have met Hillary Clinton, which
pretty much guarantees that they’re boring and bland and not very smart —
the kind of people who think Obama means well and that Jon Stewart is a laff
riot.
But let’s say it’s true. Who will we be voting for or against next year
— Public Goofus Hillary or Private Gallant Hillary?
If you evaluate presidential candidates based on how much fun they’d be to
share a drink or six with, Hillary presents a trust dilemma. Who wants to
throw back cold ones with greedy tone-deaf Public Hillary, worth $20 million
if she’s worth a dime, as she whines that she’s not “truly well off”?
But what if it’s true that Private Hillary rolls salt-of-the-earth style,
wickedly funny and cool? Should you take a leap of faith, taking the word of
the same press corps that gave us the Iraq War, and support the real —
albeit secret and seen by few — Hillary?
Perhaps you’re one of those voters who views the presidency as a role to
fill, and presidential elections as a casting call. For you, the president of
the United States is America’s representative on the world stage. He or she
has to look — and feel — presidential. Your ideal prez would exude FDR’s
charisma, wear Reagan’s suits, have Obama’s calm and JFK’s (or Mitt
Romney’s) hair.
For you image voters too, Private vs. Public Hillaries are a problem.
Public Hillary is a nonstarter. She embodies the George W. Bush school of
bull-in-a-China-shop diplomacy: the last thing we need is another war, one
caused by her deployment of the same nasty exasperated expression she wore at
the press conference where she tried to talk away her destruction of four
years of electronic archives of the foreign policy history of the United
States.
On the other hand, Loveable Private Hillary could bond with Vladmir Putin and
other troublesome world leaders, banging out peace treaties and favorable
trade agreements at karaoke bars from Pyongyang to Moscow. But what if Private
Hillary is as much of a chimera as Iraq leader Saddam Hussein’s WMDs? Public
Hillary Who Is Also Private Hillary could piss off so many old enemies, and
make so many new ones, that we’d be fending off ICBMs in no time.
Or maybe you’re like me, an issues voter. As long as he or she supports the
right policies and fight against the bad ones, you don’t care if a
politician drinks, or womanizes, or drinks and drives a woman to the bottom of
a pond. Show me the bills, dammit!
If you’re in it for substance over style, the Tale of Two Hillaries is even
more difficult to tease out.
New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd calls Hillary a “feminist icon
wallowing in regressive Middle Eastern states’ payola.” I’ll focus on
the “feminist icon” part: what, aside from being a woman, has Hillary
Clinton done for women? She has never proposed a significant piece of
women’s rights legislation. Her 2008 presidential bid marketed her, not as a
woman, but as a Margaret Thatcher-style “Iron Lady,” a man in woman’s
clothing.
Only now, echoing Obama’s double-win on the strength of historical
symbolism, is she planning to emphasize the plight of girls and women in a
patriarchal society.
On policy, Public and Private Hillary blend together. Not because she’s
integrated. Because she’s a mess of contradictions: a liberal who supports
wars of choice, obsessed with her own privacy as she runs interference for the
NSA.
Even if Gallant is the real Hillary, and all that Goofus stuff is either her
cynical attempt to work the system in a man’s world or reflects a
personality unable to connect with people in large groups, I can’t vote for
her.
She supports war and drones and the NSA. Who cares if she’s a barrel of
laughs behind closed doors? So was Josef Stalin.
Anyway, my invitation to hang out with her appears to have gotten lost in the
mail.
