American Sniper' Widow on Oscars: "It's Bittersweet"
It was hard for Taya Kyle not to cry on her way to Hollywood's biggest night.
The wife of the late Chris Kyle, the U.S. Navy SEAL who was the inspiration
for American Sniper, told People magazine that memories of her husband weighed
heavy on her mind. She is currently in the middle of a murder trial for former
marine Eddie Ray Routh, who admitted to shooting Kyle at a Texas gun range in
2013.
"I'm just hoping I make it through without sobbing my eyes out," she said. "On
the drive over here I was just fighting the tears so much.... Of course it's
bittersweet."
Kyle acknowledged she was grateful for the success of American Sniper and
celebrated on the carpet with Clint Eastwood, Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller
during the glitzy affair.
"Warner Bros. has really kind of treated me to a once-in-a-lifetime
experience," she said. "They got the dress, the jewelry, the makeup, the hair.
There's no way I could have been here without their help or looked somewhat
presentable without their help."
Sniper was the highest-grossing Oscar-nominated film, but it only took home
the Oscar for best sound editing out of its six nominations.
"I'm really grateful to them for first of all making an amazing movie that
military families can relate to," said Kyle. "On a personal level, there's no
way I could have been here without their help."
