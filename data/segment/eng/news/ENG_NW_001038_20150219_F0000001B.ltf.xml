Tsarnaev’s Lawyers in Boston Bombing Trial Ask for Change of Venue
BOSTON — A three-judge federal appeals panel on Thursday sharply questioned
lawyers in the marathon bombing case, challenging assumptions about the
ability of prospective jurors to be impartial as the judges weighed whether to
move the trial out of Boston.
Defense lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of planting deadly bombs
at the 2013 marathon finish line, say that the trial should be moved because
the case has affected almost everyone in Eastern Massachusetts and the vast
majority of people believe their client is guilty.
Sentiment against him is so pervasive, the defense argued, that even the
cement mixers at a construction site outside the federal courthouse where the
arguments were heard are plastered with “Boston Strong” — the slogan of
resilience and unity that arose after the bombings, which killed three people
and injured more than 260 others.
Lawyers for Mr. Tsarnaev have tried and failed several times to have the trial
moved, but Thursday’s hearing gave them the opportunity to make oral
arguments on the issue for the first time to three judges on the United States
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
Judith H. Mizner, a federal public defender arguing for the defense, said this
was an extraordinary case, saturated with “inflammatory” pretrial
publicity, in which most people in the jury pool had “six degrees of
connections” to the case and might not even be aware of what may affect
their ability to be impartial.
Whether to move the trial, she said, is not a “routine trial management
issue,” as the government has characterized it, but a central tenet “at
the heart of the Sixth Amendment,” which guarantees a defendant a speedy
trial by an impartial jury. (She did not note that the Sixth Amendment also
says the trial must take place in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred.)
Chief Judge Sandra L. Lynch said that Mr. Tsarnaev would suffer no irreparable
harm if the trial stayed in Boston because if he were to be convicted and
appeal that conviction, the question of the location of the trial could be
raised then.
But, Ms. Mizner countered, the main reason to move the trial is to inspire
confidence in the justice system. “Justice has to have the appearance of
justice,” she said.
Mr. Tsarnaev, 21, has pleaded not guilty to the 30 counts against him, 17 of
which carry the death penalty.
The defense team said that questionnaires filled out by more than 1,300
prospective jurors showed that 68 percent were already convinced that Mr.
Tsarnaev was guilty, that 69 percent had a personal connection to the case and
that finding a fair and impartial jury here was proving to be impossible.
But the prosecution argued that the defense had provided a “selective and
misleading” reading of those questionnaires and that, in fact, the trial
judge, George A. O’Toole Jr. of Federal District Court, had identified
several jurors so far who are qualified to sit.
As of Wednesday, over the course of 17 days, Judge O’Toole and lawyers on
both sides had interviewed 219 of the 1,373 prospective jurors. The process
was slowed by detailed discussions with each of them about the defendant’s
possible guilt and their views of the death penalty. In addition, winter
storms have closed the courthouse for several days.
Judge O’Toole has maintained that he can seat an impartial panel of 12
jurors and six alternates. His plan is to create a pool of 70 qualified
jurors, to be whittled down later by both sides through their peremptory
challenges.
So far, the court has found 61 people that it deems qualified, Ms. Mizner said
on Thursday in court. But she said that the interview process was flawed, that
it had not been able to determine whether people were genuinely able to put
aside their prejudices, and that the judge had sometimes “cut off”
questioning by lawyers meant to probe more deeply.
William D. Weinreb, an assistant United States attorney arguing for the
prosecution, said that moving a trial was justified only if a judge had
overstepped his authority, which the defense has not alleged in this case.
Judge Juan R. Torruella, who said in a previous ruling that he found the
defense’s argument compelling, took up much of the prosecution’s allotted
20 minutes with sharp questions to Mr. Weinreb about what qualified a juror as
impartial.
Mr. Weinreb said that the questionnaires cited by the defense were a “blunt
instrument” that might be useful as a starting point in evaluating a
potential juror. But, he said, the interview process had been productive, with
lawyers able to ask follow-up questions and read body language.
“Exposure to pretrial publicity alone does not disqualify a juror,” the
prosecutor said, adding that jurors are legitimately able to form opinions
“purely on evidence presented in the courtroom.”
In addition, he noted, jurors take an oath about their exposure to pretrial
publicity. The interview process has shown that people who have strong
opinions about Mr. Tsarnaev have “unhesitatingly admitted them,” he said,
leading him to conclude that the process is working.
In a brief period for rebuttal, Ms. Mizner, the defense lawyer, said that
personal connections to the case were as much a problem as pretrial publicity.
A juror in Washington, D.C., for example, would not refer to “my best friend
at the finish line,” she said, and would not have a spouse working at a
hospital that treated bombing victims, as prospective jurors here have said
under questioning.
“This is not an appropriate place to try this case,” she concluded.
The appeals court will issue its decision at a later time. After the
arguments, Judge O’Toole resumed his questioning of prospective jurors.
