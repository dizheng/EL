Iran journo at Lausanne talks seeks Swiss asylum
In the margins of intense talks in Lausanne to reach a deal over Iranâ€™s
nuclear future over the weekend an Iranian journalist took advantage of the
situation to file a request for asylum in Switzerland, media reports said.
The journalist was working for Iscanews, a news site managed by Azad
University in Tehran, which also has other sites across Iran.
Iscanews confirmed the development, the Swiss ATS news agency reported.
The journalist had been sent to Lausanne to cover the negotiations with a
photographer, German news agency DPA said.
The state secretariat for migration in Bern declined to comment on the
situation.
It does not give information on particular cases because of privacy
legislation, a spokeswoman for the secretariat told ATS.
The development occurred on the sidelines of negotiations that aimed to reach
a deal on Iran's nuclear future by a Tuesday deadline.
An agreement between Iran and world powers is "doable" with "two or three"
issues left to resolve, Tehran's lead negotiator said on Sunday, AFP reported.
 "Getting to an accord is doable," Abbas Araqchi told reporters in Lausanne.
"Solutions have been found for numerous questions," he said.
"We are still working on two or three issues . . . the talks are in their
final phase and are very difficult."
Araqchi said world powers would meet on Monday to discuss the issues.
US Secretary of State John Kerry and the German and French foreign ministers
Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Laurent Fabius were due to sit down with Chinese
foreign minister Wang Yi and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, as
well as their Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif.
They will be joined by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and his British
counterpart Philip Hammond, who was the last to arrive in Lausanne, late on
Sunday.
