Kerry still confident of Iran deal
Barack Obama agrees legislation giving Congress the right to reject an
agreement
US secretary of state John Kerry has said he is still confident of a nuclear
deal with Iran after president Barack Obama agreed to sign legislation giving
Congress the right to reject an agreement.
Mr Kerry joined his counterparts from the G7 at a meeting in northern Germany
on the gathering’s second day, flying in overnight after discussing Iran in
Washington.
“Yesterday there was a compromise reached in Washington regarding
congressional input,” he told reporters in Lubeck. “We are confident about
our ability for the president to negotiate an agreement, and to do so with the
ability to make the world safer.”
Mr Kerry said the challenge of finishing the negotiations with Iran over the
next two-and-a-half months would loom large over the G7 meeting.
Its host, German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said ministers
would discuss the deal between the US administration and Congress, which he
said would have “a certain influence” on whether a deal with Iran can be
achieved by a June 30th deadline.
Mr Steinmeier said other topics would include conflicts in the Middle East,
prospects for peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, efforts to
combat the Islamic State group, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the impact
of climate change on political stability in Africa and Asia, and the ongoing
fighting in Ukraine.
“The weather in international politics is quite stormy,” he said. “The
conflict in eastern Ukraine is only two hours away from here.”
Mr Steinmeier said the G7’s senior diplomats would also issue a statement on
maritime security, noting that Lubeck was plagued by pirates until the
Hanseatic League — an alliance of northern European trading cities —
cracked down on the practice some 600 years ago.
Although Russia was ejected from what was then the G8 last year over its
support for armed separatists in eastern Ukraine, Mr Steinmeier praised Moscow
for what he called its “constructive attitude” in not blocking a UN
Security Council resolution imposing an arms embargo on Houthi rebel leaders
in Yemen.
