The horror I saw at Garissa University in AL SHABAB's hands - I saw Christians shot dead!
One of the survivors of the Garissa University College siege has spoken about
his experience through the events of the day when their university was under
siege from Al Shabaab insurgents in a terror attack that has now claimed 70
lives and injured more than 79.
Collins Wetangula, a second year student at the University, said when the
masked gunmen entered his hostel and he could hear them opening doors and
asking if the people who had hidden inside were Muslims or Christians.
"If you were a Christian you were shot on the spot. With each blast of the gun
I thought I was going to die," Wetangula told the Associated Press (AP).
He said the terrorist struck at around 5 am and when he heard gunshots, him
and three others locked themselves in their room.
All I could hear were footsteps and gunshots nobody was screaming because they
thought this will lead the gunmen to know where they are. The gunmen were
saying, "Sisi ni Al-Shabab (Swahili for, 'We are Al-Shabab')," the students
said.
He said after two hours hiding in a dark room, Kenya's Special Forces entered
through a window and took him and some other students to safety.
