Chioma Ogwuegbu: Why I chose General Buhari over Goodluck Jonathan
Last October after the APC presidential primaries, I tweeted these words ‘I
will never vote Buhari.’ I had my reasons, the major one being my conviction
that voting a former military dictator does not bode well for a democracy.
That same reason was why I never voted General Olusegun Obasanjo the two times
he contested and won. The same reason I never voted Buhari in 2011 nor the
other times he had contested. I felt that all former military dictators had
had their time and it was time for us to move on.
I knew General Muhammad Buhari’s antecedents and track record, that of the
upright, somewhat rigid no-nonsense former military man who did not compromise
his values or his integrity. He had always run on an anti-corruption campaign
platform with the aura of someone who did not mind to go it alone if that was
what was required of him. I admired that, but I was not convinced that was all
that was required for me to give him my vote. Especially not after the
massacre that took place during the 2011 elections and all the inciting
statements that were attributed to him.
Up until February 8th, I had not decided whom I would vote or rather, I had
decided I would vote neither Buhari nor the incumbent, President Goodluck
Jonathan but I did not have any other candidate. Sometimes, I toyed with the
idea of voting Oluremi Sonaiya of KOWA Party but I did not know her track
record. As for Jonathan, I did not vote him in 2011 and it felt like in the 4
years since then he had proven why I thought it was a bad idea to not vote
him. From mismanaging the economy to mishandling that nation’s security
challenges, Jonathan has proven himself to be an incompetent leader.
The abduction of the Chibok girls and the loss of Nigeria’s territories to
insurgency due to mostly a lack of political will to tackle it convinced me
that Jonathan does not have what it takes to remain president. I have a 5
year-old somewhat precocious daughter, she has a mouth on her. Recently whilst
we were driving somewhere, Kaline’s song ‘Bring Them Home’ (a tribute to
the Chibok girls) came on the radio. My daughter said to me somberly,
‘Mommy, if somebody took me away from you, I would miss you so much?’
It saddened me that Nigeria had become a country where a 5 year-old could live
under the apprehension that some unknown persons could come steal her away
from her family. Who should get the blame for that if not the nation’s chief
security officer, Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan? On top of all of this, to me the
biggest testament to Jonathan’s failure as a president is the fact that
Buhari has become a viable alternative.
However, Buhari has not just become the viable alternative because of
Jonathan’s incompetence but also because this time he has aligned himself
with a competent, accomplished team. His campaign team has the right mix of
technocrats and politicians. His choice of Professor Yemi Osinbajo, Professor
of Law and a former attorney general of Lagos, as vice presidential candidate
speaks volumes. The first time I encountered Osinbajo was in March 2013 when
he held a meeting with some social media influencers. He spoke so eloquently
about the APC’s plans and with a deep understanding of Nigeria’s
challenges and how they could be tackled. I left that meeting hoping he would
one day be able to work for Nigeria at the national level. I was impressed
when Buhari chose him as running mate.
I am not religious so my vote will not be based on religion. I am a
nationalist so my vote will not be based on ethnic sentiments. Yet my vote
will be based on sentiments, it will be based on emotions, on love for my
country, love for my child and for myself. I do not want my beloved country to
continue down this path of perdition, I still want my daughter to have a place
she calls home 20 years from now. Buhari with his current team can put a stop
this journey towards destruction. For this reason, I choose General Muhammad
Buhari, to bring Nigeria back to the right path.
