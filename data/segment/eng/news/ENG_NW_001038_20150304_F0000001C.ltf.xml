Opposing Pictures of Tsarnaev at Boston Marathon Bombing Trial
BOSTON — Almost two years after a pair of homemade bombs brought terror and
carnage to the Boston Marathon, the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev opened on
Wednesday with the dramatic admission by his lead defense lawyer that her
client had in fact set off the blasts that killed three people and injured
scores of others.
“It was him,” the lawyer, Judy Clarke, said bluntly of her client, who sat
slouched in a chair at the defense table. She added that Mr. Tsarnaev, 21,
would not sidestep responsibility for his actions, which she described as
“inexcusable.”
But, she argued, he did not act alone. All the horror and grief of the bombing
was “caused by a series of senseless, horribly misguided acts carried out by
two brothers,” she said, naming Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother,
Tamerlan, 26, who is dead.
Dzhokhar was led, she told jurors, on “a path borne of his brother, created
by his brother and paved by his brother.”
The stark admission of culpability was made in service of her ultimate goal
— to persuade the jury to spare Mr. Tsarnaev the death penalty and sentence
him instead to life in prison.
But it was the persuasive powers of his older brother and the consequences of
homegrown terrorism that dominated the opening of a gut-wrenching trial that
is expected to last through June as it drags Boston and the country back to
the marathon finish line and the scene of the worst terrorist attack on
American soil since Sept. 11, 2001.
In the opening statements, two portraits of Mr. Tsarnaev emerged. Prosecutors
argued that he was an intellectually and emotionally committed “terrorist”
bent on avenging American military campaigns in the Muslim world, partly to
help him reach “paradise” after his death. Ms. Clarke argued that her
client was a fairly normal teenager, interested in Facebook, girls and cars,
who was under the heavy sway of the older brother he loved and respected.
The judge, George A. O’Toole Jr. of Federal District Court, limited the
degree to which the defense could bring up the defendant’s older brother in
this phase of the trial, which decides guilt or innocence. But Tamerlan seemed
to hover over the proceedings, present even in death, as the families of
victims who died and survivors who were maimed by the blasts crowded into the
packed courtroom here as the much-anticipated trial finally got underway.
Perhaps anticipating the defense’s approach, the government’s lawyers, who
spoke first, sought preemptively to smother any sympathy Ms. Clarke might stir
up for her client.
William Weinreb, an assistant United States attorney, offered searing
descriptions of how the bombs had ripped the flesh off spectators at the
marathon and sent body parts flying in the air.
He described the precise way in which shrapnel had lacerated the three victims
who died, as their families listened. Martin Richard, 8, “bled to death”
on the sidewalk; Lingzi Lu, 23, had “the inside of her stomach pouring
out”; and Krystle Campbell, 29, had “gaping holes” in her body. The
government later called five eyewitnesses, three of whom suffered grievous
injuries. All described the carnage after the bombing, their testimony
accompanied by gruesome photos and video of victims lying in pools of blood.
“I could feel my body going tingly, and I was getting increasingly cold, and
I knew I was dying,” said Sydney Corcoran, 19, whose femoral artery was
severed by the blasts, causing her to lose most of her blood.
Another witness, Rebekah Gregory, 27, walked to the stand with a prosthesis on
her left leg. “My bones were literally laying next to me on the sidewalk,”
she said. She could hear her 5-year-old son calling for her but could not
reach for him because her arm was shredded.
The defense chose not to cross-examine any of the victims who testified.
During his opening statement, which lasted about 50 minutes, Mr. Weinreb cast
the brothers as “partners in crime,” saying they planned the bombings
together and carried them out together.
The killings, he said, led Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to believe that he “had taken a
step toward reaching paradise.”
The government also laced its narrative with references to Mr. Tsarnaev as
coldhearted. Shortly after the bombings, Mr. Weinreb said, while paramedics
were still trying to resuscitate Martin Richard, Mr. Tsarnaev went to Whole
Foods and casually mulled what type of milk to buy. For the next few days,
“he hung out with friends, partied and tweeted, ‘I’m a stress-free kind
of guy,’ ” Mr. Weinreb said.
Mr. Tsarnaev showed his true colors during the shootout in Watertown with
police, Mr. Weinreb added, lobbing pressure-cooker bombs at the officers. He
said that after the shootout, Mr. Tsarnaev drove at the police at top speed,
“trying to mow them down.”
Instead, Mr. Weinreb said: “The defendant ran right over his brother and
dragged his body about 50 feet down the street.”
Ms. Clarke, whose opening lasted just 20 minutes, argued against the
government’s interpretation of Mr. Tsarnaev’s motive. She cast him as a
typical teenager — so typical, she suggested, that he felt something as
ordinary as sibling rivalry, saying that when he was hiding in a dry-docked
boat before his capture, he had written revealing words about his brother:
“He expressed he was jealous of his brother who achieved martyrdom,” she
said, adding that he wished he could achieve it, too.
“It was Tamerlan who self-radicalized,” she said. “It was Dzhokhar who
followed.” Tamerlan had influence over his younger brother, she said,
because of his age, their culture and the force of his personality.
Ms. Clarke’s blunt, even surprising admission about her client’s actions
seemed to be an effort to telegraph to the jurors that she would not waste
their time with falsehoods, in part to earn their trust.
Nancy Gertner, a former judge who teaches at Harvard Law School, called it
brilliant. By conceding that her client had committed the crimes, Ms. Gertner
said, Ms. Clarke was trying to limit the painful, graphic details the
government could bring up to undermine any sympathy for Mr. Tsarnaev.
Because Ms. Clarke is not disputing the crimes, Ms. Gertner said, those
details are no longer relevant. “The question now is, how far will the
government go to prove what she has essentially conceded?” Ms. Gertner said.
For the defense, the relationship between the two brothers will be both vital
and tricky.
While noting that “some evidence of the brothers’ interactions will be
inevitable,” Judge O’Toole said the issue of whether Mr. Tsarnaev was
“more or less culpable” than others is generally not relevant in the first
phase of the trial, before sentencing. And he curbed Ms. Clarke a couple of
times during her opening statement as she sought to amplify the family
relationships.
As she closed, Ms. Clarke pleaded with jurors to keep an open mind, especially
in the second phase of the trial, when they consider the sentence.
“It’s going to be a lot to keep your hearts and minds open,” she said,
“but that’s what we ask.”
