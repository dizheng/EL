Life in prison or the death penalty for Boston Marathon Bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev?
Following the New York Times reporting that the 2013 Boston Marathon Bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has been found guilty on all 30 counts, the question now turns to whether he will be put in prison for the rest of his life or whether he'll be put to death under capital punishment.
Which fate would you pick for him, if you could, and why?

Nobody deserves to be murdered.
Death penalty.
The federal government very rarely executes anyone so no doubt he'd be left languishing for a fair while.
the death penalty (if we're assuming he's 100% provably empirically *factually* guilty) would definitely be justified, but then again, I'm not really a death penalty guy because I don't trust the government to carry it out without ending up killing innocent people. but with *this* *******? I wouldn't care if he got tortured to death in theory - so long as he was 100% guilty and not framed/innocent. so, again, I'm not a bleeding heart liberal over the death penalty because I think if they're truly proven guilty then fair enough, let them have it, but I think the government is inefficient in everything it does, so it's dangerous. so I've voted death penalty with caution.
Heart is saying death penalty but that's just knee-jerk and I know it's not the right thing to do.
Head says Life in prison.
Edit: in some twisted way life imprisonment would be worse for that type of 'person' in any case.
In this case, I would make an exception and go for death.
Torn about this, I want this guy to suffer. Suffer big time but ultimately he deserves the death penalty. His mother is deluded as well.

I don't support the death penalty, but I don't follow the usual argument of it being 'government-sanctioned murder'. That's as flawed as saying that taxation is 'government-sanctioned theft'. Death penalty advocates could argue that in a similar way to how the money taken from taxation benefits us as the government spends it on public services, the life taken from an execution benefits all of us, because there's one less murderer around.
The reason why I oppose the death penalty (aside from the huge risk the death penalty handed down on innocent people, for example the innocent man who was released after 30 years on death row) is that ultimately, it just isn't the most effective way of making us safer. In my opinion, money spent on executions could be more effectively spent on rehabilitation of inmates during their time in prison and making them useful members of society, instead of them languishing in prison cells only to reoffend upon release.. In any case, money should also be spent on preventing radicalisation and helping poorer communities, as although poor people are certainly not genetically inclined to commit crime, once they have been deprived of opportunities, they are more likely to turn to illicit activities. That's a more effective way of reducing the number of crimes committed in the first place.
What I hate about the death penalty debate is that both sides base their arguments on an appeal to emotion rather than the facts
Life in prison.
Don't give him have the opportunity of becoming a martyr.
Life imprisonment. Was he not going to blow himself up anway? 
Death penalty
he could end up radicalizing more offenders
What he did was outrageous, leaving people dead, with broken legs and making one blind for eternity.
As much as this my contradict my beliefs as a person, i must say the death penalty afterall people come out of prison unchanged.
This may seems harsh but something must be done, countless of lives are being endangered simply because of barbaric people like him.

The sort of Prison he would go to would not offer many opportunities for that. Presumably he would be in a super max prison, where he would spend the majority of his time in solitary confinement. Any prisoners he came across would likely also be in for life.
I have to say life in prison. I simply do not agree with the death penalty in any circumstance.
Life in prison. But a very awful prison not one of those cushy ones :rolleyes:
Life in prison is a far worse fate than death.
I don't see the point in the death penalty when Death is his goal.

If he wanted death that badly then he would of killed himself or went out in a blaze of glory, the coward pulled back from the edge and is trying to place the blame all onto his brother but not before he murdered many men. women and children. The sniveling coward deserves to feel the terror and complete absence of hope while lying strapped to the bed crying for help, right before he is put down like the filthy pig that he is.
I hate the argument constantly brought against death penalty of "oh life in prisons much worse anyway" well surely if that is the case then death penalty is more humane and the state should be allowed to do it then? The justice system shouldn't be all about rehabilitation it should be about punishment. I don't buy into the belief that justice, revenge and emotion shouldn't play any part in the Justice System. It should be about Justice, Public Safety &amp; Rehabilitation some people should fall into the first and second categories as they are beyond being rehabilitated.
It doesn't mean that I agree with the US Justice Systems methods or ways as I believe too many people get the death penalty where their guilt is in doubt, I also don't agree with the long drawn out expensive process over there, nor the barbaric methods such as Hanging, Electric Chair and Gas Chamber. 
I would personally allow only the worst criminals to be executed such as serial killers or murder that involves torture etc..., also I would only allow it in cases where there is absolutely no doubt that they are guilty where the evidence is 100%, and where they show no remorse and also where the victim is innocent also. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev fits the bill.
Solitary confinement for the rest of his life.

Well, he was unarmed when he was caught, so I am not sure how he is going out in a blaze of glory. 
Anyway, he is going to care if he dies. He believes his brother is in heaven so I am not sure why he is going to care if he dies.
I'm against the death penalty so I don't believe he should get that. However, life in prison is hardly any better than the death penalty in my opinion, and perhaps worse.
Personally I think he should be treated well and let out again when he's older if he's not deemed a continued threat to society.
