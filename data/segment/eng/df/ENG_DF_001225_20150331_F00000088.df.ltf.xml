I saw American Sniper yesterday
My dad get free tickets to the move, I thought it was good. IDK why people say it's a horrible movie.

I don't think I ever heard anyone hate on it...most people said they loved it.
That review is spot on, thanks for the insight!
It was my favorite Disney Channel cartoon even though Jake was annoying as fuck
I heard people didn't like it for 1. fake baby 2. how they portrayed the Iraqis 
Me, I enjoyed the war movie and I'm not a fan of war movies. I think the focus and perception of this "war movie" sold it for me. 
Would watch again!
It was good and just that. Not great I can't score it higher than a 7.
Coop was good, and Eastwoods direction was great, but the script and the rest of the cast was serviceable at best.
Tapatalk sig.
Movie as such was good but the way they portrayed iraqis didnt go well with me. Furthermore the way people went merica fuck yeah just spoiled the movie for me.
