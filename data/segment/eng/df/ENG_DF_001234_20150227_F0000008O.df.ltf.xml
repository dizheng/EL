War with Russia
hate to say it but I can't see a way out of this, Putin has never/will never capitulate and NATO have squared up

Russia's economy continues to spiral downwards as no one wants to do business with them.
Russia is no longer able to pay for its armed forces or pensions.
Putins position becomes less and less tenable.

China takes most of eastern Siberia.
BBC broadcasts people in Moscow pulling down statues of Putin and hitting them with shoes.
best case scenario right there
Oh and if Putin is out, and then some idealist socialists take control like once before, things will turn out great! hehe
This idea that the West can just shove a puppet dictator into power there once Putin is out, and not cause political fractures like we've seen in Ukraine in the last year is just bonkers!
Imagine rebels with control of nuclear weapons... Nice.
Anyone would think the West *wants* ww3!

Slow escalation is the only possible path for the US to achieve its objectives in the current scenario. The Russians have not "expanded" anywhere in this conflict.
I was suggesting that wrt Russia.
Others allude to Russia being aggressive and warmongering and absolutely wanting war. So why mess around? They'd have been better going all in a year ago and taking all the East European ex Soviet Union territories before Nato could respond conventionally.
Yes, conversely, for the Usa to do their banana republic thing, slow subversive is the only route.
Now the USA has screwed up Ukraind it's back to Syria, Iraq and no doubt Libya, those other recent success stories of Western intervention hehe

I'm not one for conspiracy theories, I find them hilarious because they are so far removed from the things people actually should be worried about and I do not think WW3 is on the cards.
That being said the last World War pulled the US out of the depression.

Why is the choice Putin or Rebel nuclear anialation? Surly the most likely outcome is Russia's existing democratic structure kicks in, and they get politicians who are actually accountable to the people?

Just like in Ukraine, with their recent democratic elections?

I'm not one for conspiracy theories either. But I'm also not a subscriber to the idea wars just 'start' by accident through unconsidered posturing and escalation.
Former deputy PM Netsmov, an opposition politician, has been sot dead in Moscow.
Mr Putin's mates do we think?

I wouldn't be surprised.

No way, Putin is bigger than Jesus.
there are two versions and Putin has the problem with both of them
1st : his people are that stupid to kill the opposition leader in front of the Kremlin
2nd(much more probable) : foreign agents are killing people in front of the Kremlin and setting up the false flag
either way - he has the problem

He was opposed to Russia's War with the Ukraine and was about to lead a large protest against it.
He recently said "he feared Mr Putin would have him killed because of his opposition to the war in Ukraine."

Dave,
The Ukrainian people had a democratic vote.
The Petro Poroshenko Bloc won the most seats (132 seats) in the election (because of its lead in single-seat constituencies) with the People's Front (who gained more votes than the Petro Poroshenko Bloc on the nationwide party list[22]) coming second with 82 seats.[23] 94 independent candidates won a seat in single-seat constituencies, Self Reliance won 33 seats, the Opposition Bloc 29 seats, the Radical Party 22 seats, Fatherland 19 seats, Svoboda 6 seats, Right Sector 1 seat, Strong Ukraine 1 seat, Volia 1 seat, and Zastup also 1 seat.[23] For the first time since Ukraine's 1991 independence Communists have no parliamentary representation.[23][24] The official voter turnout was set at 52.42%.[25] 57% was the turnout in the previous 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election.[26]
Chocolate man won.
Where were you?
Please note Svoboda only won 6 seats so please don't go down the facist, nazi rant route.

Russia's only real democratic alternative to Putin...

So Putin continues to take Russia further back towards the early days of the cold war, if not beyond.
Russian society must surely be starting to wake up and smell the vodka. There have been that many allegations of election fraud, organised crime connections, and opposition leader 'accidents' during Putin's reign that something has to give. 
They're already in a North Korea type situation where anybody who stands as a critic of Putin (Pussy Riot, Litvenenko, et al) can expect a visit from the Police, or worse, some of his old FSB mates who don't intend taking you back as a prisoner.
He's about as good of an example of a blatantly corrupt dictator as you get.

Eh?
Ukraine had democratic elections.
They now have civil war.
Perfect example that ousting Putin democratically via Western pressures may fracture Russia into vying capitalist/socialist leaning factions, among many others.
Which is the point I'm making.
Pushing Putin out of leadership may result in a worse Russia.
But hey that is the Western way.
Make any potential opponent or defiant government a shambles so they can be manipulated. Just look at every country the USA has been involved in for the last 40 years.
Fine if that is what they like doing, but Russia has nuclear weapons. Potentially having them fall into the control of rebels isn't ideal. Especially if that then means the USA has to go in to protect the world from rebels with nuclear weapons.
Talk about false flags. It's playing out just like a shallow as a puddle Western spy thriller!
