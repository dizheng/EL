Governorship Polls: Jonathan Warns Against Intimidation Of Nigerians
http://leadership.ng/news/423798/guber-polls-jonathan-warns-against-intimidation-of-nigerians
When he and his wife were forming Rambo in Rivers, Bayelsa, and Ekiti States, imposing thugs as Governors, recklessly interfering with the powers of a duly elected governor, playing politics with the unbridled butchery of thousands of hapless Nigerians, and his pathetic wife constituting herself into an unmitigated political nuisance, He never deemed it fit to give us this 'Salvation Army' speech undecided
Now that the shoe is on the other foot, GEJ has suddenly metamorphosed into Pope Jonathan Paul, preaching peace, tolerance, and fairness everywhere he goes angry
Yes, Nigerians understand the need for peace and fairness in the upcoming elections. ... But we don't need a chameleon like GEJ to tell us that. .. And no, APC won't act all 'fair and just', and allow blood-hounds like Fayose and Agbaje remain or get into power angry .....
CHANGE MUST BE TOTAL !!! angry
Say no to intimidation.......nice one from the agent of peace my amiable GEJ
All l know is APGA for imo state.......captain ihenacho is the best man for job
APGA for Abia.......Alex otiti is the man
APGA for Nasarawa.......labaran maku victory shall be yours
APGA onye a ha na nwanne ya cheesy cheesy cheesy cheesy
Kokoronko....chi efuo grin grin grin
Nice one from Mr President. cool
If Jonathan didn't spend the past 6 years getting high on alcohol while Fayose, Koro, Wike and Shepopotamus were running amok creating confusion we wouldn't get here.
Was he deaf dumb and mute when Arthur Eze was calling people Amala Ppl in his presence 2 years ago. 
Just pack your load, Buhari would correct every misrule
Apc party should listen to Mr President and stop causing trouble in Ekiti, lagos and Rivers state
I hope he is also going to personally warn nyesom wike and patience jonathan because they are causing nuisance in rivers state....
Well said, Mr. President.... cheesy cheesy
#votenotfight
Hmm.....
Is Jona still a President? Things have been quiet around him lately.
Igbos are the Jews of Africa....
Any Naija State without the Igbos is dead economically....
Better
Did the "Super hero" suddenly grew brains? Why didn't he said this when his wife made the "Stone them" statement? Let me just keep mute on Fayose, Wike, Asari, Koro, Eze etc...Let's just focus on your wife, after all charity begins at home.

Lol... He gats to act like an elder statesman, do you want him to lose his "Super hero" title cheesy.
Honestly, I tot our President was on sabbatical all these while after the election. Now he remembers he's still the President till at least May 29th. We need him to be active now than before, no matter what. Am not his govt fan, but I think we need him now.
Doing/ saying the right thing at the wrong time... When he, his wife and his cohorts were harassing Amaechi and those they saw as enemies, where were this thoughts?? Adieu President Emeritus... It's obvious people tend to reason well and turn good when they lose power.
This where this man so fits well: peace and conflict resolutions, not presidency. 
Scratching to hear PEJ. Its been a long while.
Ok
that's nice of him, poo!

My amiable president, Nigerians have heard your warning, it is loud and clear

Battle of kini?
Politicians in States like Rivers, Imo and Lagos should be kept under surveillance...The way they play politics in those states is horrible
Jona

Let's all come together in peace and vote our choice. No candidate imposition would work.
APC for Lagos though.
