Hillary Clinton Room Post. Chris Matthews is reporting Hillary will announce Sunday.
Hillary Clinton Room Post.
The moment is here and it is time to savor it.
1. Yeah I am hearing it is very close....her team has been told to prepare....
2. I can't wait to see her on the campaign trail.
3. I cannot wait to watch a certain group of DU'ers heads explode....
5. Well that Hillary DU operatives post made me put a few on ignore.
7. Yep I am using "ignore" a whole lot more than I used to....
10. It works well.
I think one person I might rethink but the others I won't miss anytime soon.
29. I just added another one to Ignore. They can talk to each other.
They have absolutely nothing of importance to say about Sec Hillary, from here on.
Everything about Hillary I read or post will be right here in the Hillary Room where it belongs.
They have nothing constructive to add anyway so they have no place on my DU Screen.
POOF They're Gone!!!
What a great exciting year we will have.
And it starts this Sunday.
God speed Hillary, see you in the Oval Office 2016
8. And Republicans
She will make the candidates crazy.
11. Its going to be great!
12. Of course. They know that she can beat them.
Going to be fun to watch the gop squirm.
4. Would someone please post me a link of her speach, will be out on a weekender
No news, no radio, no tv, will only have phone access. I knew this might happen.
6. Sure but it might be low key.
But yes we will post it in this room.
9. Thank you so very much.
13. Chris Matthews just said it was this Sunday
I'm glad. Maybe some of the mis-information about her and her record will calm down.
14. Great. I will change the title.
15. Sunday via video. Then she will talk agenda &amp; policy through her tour.
Yaaaa. Can't wait!!!
Finally
16. I feel like ringing out some bells.
22. glad you posted those joyous bells here also.
23. lol I seem to be posting them all over.
24. Most Appropriate. Ringing of the Bells!
I am so happy tonight
25. And people were so sure she wasn't running.
28. Wishful thinking.
17. She will get her message out thru Social Media &amp; her tours.
She can get her actual message to millions directly via social media rather having her agenda filtered &amp; opined by MSM.
Her Team of savvy professionals will handle her campaign as it should be.
What people hear will be her own words. Not the RW owned media's version.
18. This is smart. She learned from the 2008 mistakes.
19. Can you imagine the excitement if this happens?

20. I don't think the gop can beat a Hillary/Castro ticket.
30. Clinton/Castro would blow up Jeb's dream of aligning with the Hispanic voters.
I love Castro for everything he represents.
So will the 2016 voters.
21. More bells.
26. The day I have been waiting for!
27. A joyous moment.
31. Me too William769. This is a Really Big Deal isn't it. Finally!!
Hey I hope you are feeling well. Rest up cuz The Big Game is about to begin!
Wooohoooo**
32. I checked out a related thread
in GD not too long ago. There were a few posters who expressed a lack of enthusiasm for the announcement, yet they bothered to view (and comment) on the page. It's stupid.
33. They know thwt they likely can not stop her and they are frustrated by it.
34. Come on our Gal!
35. Business Insider: Rubio is to announce this weekend, however he will be overshadowed in the media by
Hillary Clinton. Also saying Rubio will not enjoy the benefit of free press that others like Rand &amp; Cruz had at their Pres race announcement.
Poor Marco. A day late &amp; a dollar short.
Overshadowed again.
36. Lol! I bet he moves the day.
37. He'll be playing that marco...polo game for press time.
.........marrrco. polo
..................................marrrrco
..polo.
( softly now) marrrrco.
..(all together now) P O L O.
38. Freaking hilarious!
39. Ha.. Humor will be our greatest weapon
We are gonna be just fine in the Hillary Room this year.
Waaaay more fun than GD.
We Rock the Hillary Room man!!
40. I think you are right.
