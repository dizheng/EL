I have been watching the story developing. The extremists really don't like education do they?...I hope the Kenyans manage to kick their hairy butts out their Country...do you know if this was the Russians doing this there would be public outrage.
I think its a matter of Al Shabaab not being viewed as proper Muslims following the Islamic ideology...big mistake. These are the crack pots that Lee Rigby's murderers were very attracted to.

The uneducated are far easier to control. 
Sadly, I think it's a bit of both.

Not to mention our very own 'white widow' Samantha Lewthwaite.

BIB So very true. How many Jihadi's could they hold onto if they knew for a scientific fact the world was not flat?

Well let's be honest, the cowardly arsewipes can't actually fight. All they can do is take hostages and murder innocent people. Killing, murder and mayhem is what this particular branch of Islam is all about.
It'd been noted on here before African atrocites tend to be at the bottom of most people's radar. I'm not sure it's an African thing or a race thing, if there was a similar atrocity in Burma/Nepal/Cambodia it would probably be similarly low on the attention scale. Saying that if it did happen in a 'white' country it probably would get more attention, so maybe it's a combination of race &amp; distance involved.
France 24 reporting death toll may rise significantly, one survivor saying she stepped over at least 100 bodies.
Reports of them using chainsaws to kill people.
They're savages.
It's now being reported that at least 70 people were murdered.
According to an Al-shebaab spokesman the terrorists are releasing Muslims and killing Christians
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-32169080
So who's going to be first to deny this is an act of barbaric religious bigotry committed by Muslims?
It's not the fault of Mossad, Or America. Or capitalism. There are no grey areas here. There is no nuance. There are no "yeah-but-whatabouts". These people want a religious war.

Have the police apologised for this atrocity yet?

It's happening all over the Muslim world, unfortunately. Christians have recently been targeted by Islamists in Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and now Kenya.

Strange that Muslims and their apologists always complain about so-called 'Islamophobia' in secular Western democracies (who provide them with everything possible to lead a good fulfilling life) and yet they never mention how people other faiths and none are treated in Islamic countries (badly at best, slaughtered at worst).
The silence is totally deafening.
Hypocrisy in action.

Islamists aren't real muslims!

It comes down to who people identify with.
9/11 shocked the western world because the vast majority of people recognise themselves going to work in the morning in a big office building, commuting. living in an advanced society, living in a developed, orderly city, ect, and if not themselves, people around them.
When those poor girls were kidnapped by Boko Harem, their lives (or what we see of their lives) are so removed it's hard to imagine yourself in the same circumstances. Things like the reports from the few who escaped about running into the jungle and hiding for days.
It is like hearing about something from another planet. The world has got smaller because of mass media, but it's still very big.
How does it happen that a truck load of terrorists can drive into a school and kidnap children, and get away with it?
Almost 150 now reported as being murdered. Their barbarism knows no bounds. Sickening, totally sickening.

In that case, in Nigeria, there is huge corruption, so much so that the soldiers on the ground have had to buy their own ammunition &amp; uniforms (hence they don't match, leading to confusion). Of course there probably weren't any on duty at that school anyway. And it seems there were only two armed guards at this university of 800 people in Kenya, how could that possibly be the case when they knew of threat &amp; there had been attacks in that very town? You have to suspect corruption again sadly, the money from taxes is not getting to the people &amp; services to the people but in pockets of those in influential positions.
Now confirmed, at least 147 murdered.
NOW is it a war between religions?
Kenya's off my holiday list. That's most of africa now.

Was that your first thought?
Something a read the other week, Christians are persecuted around the world in Islamic countries but you don't see terrorism aimed at Muslims. Due to our foreign policy some Muslims feel violence against the West is justified.
Last month a bomb attack in Pakistan killed 14 Christians and destroyed their church, this week you 150 people dead by Boko Harem.
In less than a month there has been almost 200 people, mostly Christians killed by Islamic terrorism.
That doesn't include those recently captured on Syria.
It's my experience that many people in the UK (and Europe generally) don't differentiate countries in Sub-Saharan Africa all that much. We've been reading/hearing about one group murdering other similar groups for as long as I can recollect and it just becomes one more tragedy on top of an endless number. People are inured to it. I'm not sure how else it can be as it seems no amount of concern or aid makes much long term difference.
