#APC Change!
Here in otuoke we are MARCHING
To the nearest POLLING
We'd keep CHILLING
As we are patiently WAITING
We'll be VOTING
For the ryt PERSON
Not for the party RULING
A government of STEALING
And of LOOTING
Whom Tanoids claimed is TRANSFORMING.
I cant even feel their BREEZING
Tell them to stop LYING
No need of FORMING
But i can see things are CHANGING
Relax,change is COMING
Pvc is DUSTING
Let us start SWEEPING
As we'll be CASTING
For the man that has been LEADING.
Gosh!stop LAUGHING
You know i'm RHYMING
Trust mii i dnt like TROLLING
So its not FUNNY
Just vote out our ENEMY
And start Receiving God's BLESSINGS
After VOTING
Just keep STANDING
Or get a SEATING
And continue LOOKING
As they'll be COUNTING
To prevent RIDGING
When they're about FINISHING
Start SHOUTING
Or should i say SCREAMING
And maybe CHANTING
SAI BUHARI! SAI BUHARI!! SAI BUHARI!!!
Okay!i'll be bk...
Meanwhile,violence Rocks Onyigbo area of Lagos,SW Nigeria...
