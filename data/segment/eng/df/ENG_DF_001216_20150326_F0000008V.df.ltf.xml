Bush 38
Clinton 50
Walker 36
Clinton 51
Rubio 35
So much for all the self-proclaimed political experts who claimed emailgate would doom Hillary.
They're a couple points off on Walker and Rubio. But yeah, the emailgate fallout has yet to occur. emailgate needs a smoking gun first - right now it's really just a "I'm too cool to follow tradition" situation, which voters don't really care about.
St. Leo University? What do we know about their record?

Eh, I highly doubt those numbers are true. If we dismiss Gravis, we really should dismiss this one, too.

From a cursory glance of their site:
Final FL-Gov poll: Crist up 3 (4 point miss)
FL-26: Curbelo up 4 (nailed it)
Their track record is more thin than bad, so better than Gravis, though that's obviously not saying much.

The average error on 2014 polls was bad across the board due to the unpredictably abysmal turnout.

The polls weren't actually that bad, by the standards of recent midterm elections:

The polling misfires of 2014 have greater precedent if we broaden the comparison to include different measures and elections held in the 1990s and earlier. For example, Nate Silver’s initial assessment of average bias— whether polls collectively favored one party or the other—in 2014 found an average four percentage point understatement of Republican Senate margins. However, this calculation also revealed an equally large bias against the Republicans (4.0) in 2002 and an even bigger bias against the Democrats (4.9) in 1998.
