U.S. expected to remove Cuba from state sponsors of terrorism list.
I suppose that Cuba should reciprocate.
How many times did the CIA try to kill Castro?
Down votes? Here's 10 http://m.mentalfloss.com/article.php?id=30010
I think you are getting downvoted because it seems like you are saying that Cuba should try to kill the president?
Interestingly enough, lots of people think Cuba had something to do with killing JFK.
I was trying to say Cuba should remove the US from their State sponsored terrorist list.
Seems obvious to me...
Doesn't read that way, seems like people are having hte same issue.
There, that's a lot less ambiguous and less assassinate-y while remaining succinct
Some people think it was actually the cia
i think the only person who hasn't been blamed is Jackie O, and even she would have been blamed had she not been filmed picking pieces of her husband's head off the back of the presidential limo
Nah she's been blamed. They say she orchestrated the hit because JFK gave her the clap.
Their proof being that she married so soon afterwards.
I'm firmly of the opinion that if it was a conspiracy (which is unlikely, honestly) it was LBJ.
A conspiracy by Cuba could be outed pretty easily without much real consequence to the integrity of the US government, finding out that a sitting vice president killed a current president and then plowed the US straight into Vietnam, however, would cause a severe crisis of trust for roughly half of the US. That's the sort of secret conspiracy I could understand keeping secret.
? never heard that EVER. sounds like youre talking out your ass

Is the US on its own list?
Can't Cuba have a list? Course it's probably not very long.
1. USA
Don't see why not. Just saying that we should be on our own list.
It's our own list.
From our perspective the CIA are not terrorists. According to the Government they're the good guys. They spread freedom through subterfuge.
Things are really looking up for defrosting Cuba relations. Maybe I'll be able to take a vacation there without jumping through 50 state department hoops one day.
Interesting, do they just plop any country they happen to dislike on the terror list?
yes.
You can argue about any specific country but the overall answer to your question is Yes. That list should not be taken at face value at all.
Yes.
No, despite what everyone else is saying. Any given person might not agree with the reasoning, but it wasn't just because we don't like them.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Sponsors_of_Terrorism#Cuba
According to Country Reports on Terrorism 2010: August 18, 2011:[4]
Designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1982, the Government of Cuba maintained a public stance against terrorism and terrorist financing in 2010, but there was no evidence that it had severed ties with elements from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and recent media reports indicate some current and former members of the Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) continue to reside in Cuba. Available information suggested that the Cuban government maintained limited contact with FARC members, but there was no evidence of direct financial or ongoing material support. In March, the Cuban government allowed Spanish Police to travel to Cuba to confirm the presence of suspected ETA members. Cuba has been used as a transit point by third-country nationals looking to enter illegally into the United States. The Government of Cuba is aware of the border integrity and transnational security concerns posed by such transit and investigated third country migrant smuggling and related criminal activities. In November, the government allowed representatives of the Transportation Security Administration to conduct a series of airport security visits throughout the island. Regional and International Cooperation: Cuba did not sponsor counterterrorism initiatives or participate in regional or global operations against terrorists in 2010.
It was added because Cuba has a history of funding and arming organizations like FARC. And before anyone replies "BUT SO DOES AMERICA," which is reasonable... that's not an argument for taking Cuba off of the list, but changing America's behavior and/or including it on the list, if you believe that America does such things.
It was because they fund(ed) terrorism and we don't like them.
But that looks like it's changing (they're looking to broker a peace deal rather than funding FARC), so... it looks like their status on the list might change, too.
that may be true, but also Saudia Arabia funds terrorism, but since we like them, they're not on the list. It also depends on what "terrorism" is, since the US sponsored several coups that could be considered terrorist in nature, thus putting the US on the list.
At best it's not a comprehensive list, and at worst it's an arbitrary list used for propaganda purposes.
I'm going to go out on a limb and assume you stopped reading after the quoted material?
Neither. The list is a means to use America's global reserve currency as a way to sanction countries without formally sanctioning them. Conducting international commerce in currencies other than $US is less efficient and limits access to commodities markets. Putting someone or some country on this list means the Treasury gets to freeze dollar-denominated assets wherever they are found, to include banks in countries who like to cooperate with the US.
The US is currently housing a terrorist who killed over a 100 people in a plane bombing in Cuba BTW. The US refuses to extradite and the Cuban 5 were arrested for spying on him and other anti Cuban terrorists housed in Miami. Jose Posada Carrilles.
Yes. But given the USA's track record they should also be on their own list.

how's the 9th grade going?
Eglin is that you?
lol? the air base. I love those conspiracy theorists.
If it is true the US government is completely retarded. Why do that on a military base? you can do it anywhere in the country.
Not sure, flyboys are pretty patriotic and don't perhaps, ask many pesky questions. Perhaps decent office space, good coffee, jets, big posters of us flag underwear wearing, caped eagles? I really don't know actually. Its no conspiracy theories though many countries do it, I don't think the us is that incompetent not to have such an agency, the cia will practically choke someone to death if they didn't allocate funds for it in this day and age.
Israel does it, the US did so in Operation Mockingbird also.
for a large number of those countries, they'll say that this group or that group sponsored terrorists. this explanation fails to mention the sheer frequency that in the decades before that, the US was there too, funding and training and enabling the "terrorist supporters" in the first place.
To some extent, but Cuba was legitimately placed on the list for their support of FARC. What is actually harder to do is to get off the list once one is on the list if one is disliked.
The US isn't on it, so you know it has to be taken with a grain of salt.
Maybe I'll be able to take a vacation there without jumping through 50 state department hoops one day.
I thought you couldn't do that? Becuase if you get your passport stamped or have any travel record to Cuba, you can get into some big trouble.
Cuba doesn't stamp American passports for just that reason.
I learned something new today
It's not true. I'm a American who traveled to Cuba through my university. They still stamped my passport
Isn't that one of the few legit ways to visit though? Education or Media?
There's 12 legal ways to visit:
Family visits
Official business of the U.S. government, foreign governments, and certain intergovernmental organizations
Journalistic activity
Professional research and professional meetings
Educational activities
Religious activities
Public performances, clinics, workshops, athletic and other competitions, and exhibitions
Support for the Cuban people
Humanitarian projects
Activities of private foundations or research or educational institutes
Exportation, importation, or transmission of information or information materials
Certain export transactions that may be considered for authorization under existing regulations and guidelines.
8 Support for the Cuban people
Is that one a trap or something?
I read it as: Its ok to support the people just not the government.
11. Exportation, importation, or transmission of information or information materials
Bring a tourist guide back with you (importation of information materials). Now your trip is 100% kosher.
Yeah that's how you end up in a Cuban prison.
No, not at all. You get a free trip to Bah√≠a de Cochinos.
We call it Giron.
But you have to walk since air support isn't provided.
