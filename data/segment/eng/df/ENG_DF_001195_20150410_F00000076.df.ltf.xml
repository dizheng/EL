Hillary Clinton expected to announce presidential run this weekend
"WASHINGTON â€” Hillary Clinton is expected to announce her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 as early as this weekend, facing no substantial competition but needing to get her organization in place for the long battle to come.
A variety of sources in the Clinton orbit said they were anticipating an imminent announcement but would not confirm a report in the New York Daily News that the announcement was expected on Sunday.
Clinton is likely to make her intentions known through a social media announcement followed by campaign travel. This focus on digital communications is an attempt to connect with young voters, who Clinton needs to become American's first woman president.
The Guardian newspaper reported that Clinton would make her announcement on Twitter at noon eastern time on Sunday while headed to the early voting state of Iowa, followed up by email and video announcements."

Will the American voters allow a woman president directly after a black president though? That's the elephant in the room.
I am not excited to have to choose between Hillary and whatever chucklehead wins the GOP nomination.
Doesn't look like anyone in the Dem party wants to run against her. She's got a straight path to the nomination, tho Bernie announcing could make things interesting for a while (he has no chance).
Any idea who will be her running partner?

Why wouldn't they?
Why wouldn't they?
Because conservative voters are very strong willed, and democrats are kinda wimpy.

if Texans were able to elect a Liberal Woman Democrat for Governor then for sure Americans can vote for an establishment Woman Democrat for President

I'd say the same applied when Obama was running for president. I think you are talking more about voters being retaliatory towards Hillary after Obama's presidency, but I don't think there'd be enough of those voters to make a difference.

Elephant? I though she was part of the democratic party! 
In all seriousness, it would interesting to see if a woman as a president would be any different.
Yay 19 months of the media ignoring real news for election BS.
Not that it hasn't already been happening the previous 19 months.

well, speaking honestly, it feels like this is Hillary's election to lose.
unless she fucks up majorly, or some act of god candidate shows up,

Davis didn't win? Although you might be thinking of our mayor in Houston but that's a more liberal city in general.
Unless that was sarcastic.
I get the impression a lot of conservatives like Hillary looking at her like the next Thatcher.

I don't see why not.
Having the women voter block is a major advantage. And I think the block of people who won't vote for a woman (no matter the person) has to be shrinking.
And she's remarkably centrist. She can be appealing to all walks of life, even some moderate Republicans.

They only gave positive coverage to Hillary at first because they hate Obama more because he actually became President. If Hillary had won, we would've had seven years of, "look, we could've dealt with somebody like Obama who talked about there not being a red and blue America, instead of the disuniter in chief, Hillary Rodham Clinton."

Black woman no

Hillary is such a known quantity that her being a woman feels like something of a non-factor at this point.

Probably means Ann Richards
Derp
Just wasn't thinking of her given the time frame in which she was elected and the modern comparison he used.
American politics is at such a low point

Well Warren DID only say she wasn't going to run for "president..."
It sounds like some Hillaryous times ahead.
for voters who remember rosier positive economic times during the latter half of the 1990s in times of relative peace, associate it to the Clinton name.
Hillary will do well

I get the impression (anecdotal anyways) that she'll pick up pretty much all the Hispanics who were happy with Bill's presidency too. Their kids (and everyone else's) should get off their asses and vote too.
I'm not from the US. Can someone explain me what makes them question whether Hillary will be a good president?
Not sure how electable she is. Lot of potential issues - Benghazi, emails and the biggest of all, Bill. Will be popular among the Democratic base and the frontrunner for the nom, no doubt, but if the Republicans somehow manage to actually get their shit together she will be in trouble.

That would be a huge waste of her influence.

Bill is going to be a huge asset to her. Banghazi just isn't going to stick, they've been trying since the day it happened... It'll be 3 full years of failing to make it into something this fall. The emails also turned into nothing.
That would be a huge waste of her influence.
I don't know, maybe she'll end up being GIFable like Biden!

are we under the assumption it wasn't hillary's own camp who released the info to minimize its effect during the election run?

Yes, Bill "73% approval rating" Clinton is an issue. Bill Clinton would be on 7th term by now if he was allowed. :)

Nobody is more GIFable than Biden. That's his true calling. He should be VP again!

Normally I completely and utterly disagree with everything you say Schatt... but yes.
This is the worst presidential year I've been alive to experience. Maybe I'm just salty coming off the amazing Obama years.
Isn't she just assumed to have this one in the bag already? Current republican frontrunners are complete jokes, and swing voters are going to swing her way no problem, they'll choose a boring "remember how sweet the 90s were!?" over any whackjob republican wanting to outlaw the moon or some shit.
I'll be voting for her...because who else is there?

lol
First off, nobody outside the republican base thinks about Benghazi and the email thing was introduced so early in this cycle to where it barely produced a hickup and will be taken care of by the time next year comes around.
Honestly I think that her own camp released that shit to get it out of the way, considering it was released the same day Bibi was speaking at the white house and that whole clusterfuck.
Will not support!

Jeb Bush might understandably give her issues.
he has a lot of pull in Florida, and he can fool a large percentage of the hispanic vote due to the fact he speaks spanish. put him on a national podium and have him speak an essay in spanish, and watch the pendulum swing hard his way. no joke.

You mean the same Bill that won Obama the 2nd term among hundreds of other things?
Doesn't look like anyone in the Dem party wants to run against her. She's got a straight path to the nomination, tho Bernie announcing could make things interesting for a while (he has no chance).
If the Dems want to win though, they need people to actually run to have a field. If this looks like the Dems are just coronating their nominee it's not going to look good.
Strategically it's also poor since it would let the Republican candidates all attack hilary instead of them having to talk about each other.
Honestly, this election comes down to this for me. 
Does this person believe in a anthropomorphic climate change, and will they continue to build off of Obama's executive actions in reducing emissions? 
Which means the entire republican field just got thrown out the window.

Nobody cares about the primaries but the fringes.
She isn't going to be president.
Everyone should ready themselves for President Jeb Bush now.

Jeb is potentiality the Repuplican the most apt at attracting as many Hispanic voters as brother W. did or even better than W. 
Jeb's Spanish speaking skills are exponentially better than W.'s and Jeb isn't afraid to speak it.
Can't read it.

I believe he can fool the swing voters, but anyone who voted for Bill Clinton is going to need more than an essay or promises that his party's base are vehemently against.
The republicans also need A LOT more than Florida to hit 270. I look forward to seeing them battle for dear life in Virginia, Pennsylvania Indiana AND Ohio.
Edit: Damn, Penn has gone blue for a while. Reagan is a God (or the Devil for some others, I guess).

Things must be pretty different out west and in Florida. Must be my experience as a New York Hispanic coloring my expectations.

That's what Hillary thought in 2008.
