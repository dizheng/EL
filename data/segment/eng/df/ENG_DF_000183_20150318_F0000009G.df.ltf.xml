Obama blames the guy actually responsible for the birth of ISIS for giving birth to ISIS. BASTARD!
I'm LOVING the right-wing outrage over this.

President Barack Obama traced the origins of Islamic State militants back to the presidency of George W. Bush and the invasion of Iraq back in 2003, arguing that its growth was an unintended consequence of the war.
In an interview with Vice News, President Obama said the rise of Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIS/ISIL) can be directly linked to Americas excursion into Iraq under Bush.
Two things: One is, ISIL is a direct outgrowth of Al-Qaeda in Iraq that grew out of our invasion, Obama said in an interview with VICE News. Which is an example of unintended consequences. Which is why we should generally aim before we shoot. 
Obama stated that he is confident a coalition consisting of 60 nations will slowly push back ISIL out of Iraq, but added that the challenge of stopping extremism wont stop unless there is a political solution to the internal strife affecting so many countries in the Middle East.
1. Wow, look how long Cheney's right arm is - that is amazing.
n/t
9. No, that's his left...oh, I see.
A ton of bricks, a ton of feathers, it's still gonna hurt.
15. Cheney looks like a ventriloquist with a Bush dummy
40. Yeah, the arm goes up W's butt and out his sleeve!
That's really sumpin'!
61. That's why you never see his back. The head stick and controls are exposed.
26. CHeney came out today and said Obama worst president of all time
I want dickless to be shamed somehow, in a severe way
51. all that exercise raising it and shouting "Sieg Heil!" has had an effect.
pasty white skin results from spending so much time wearing sheets, suppose??
55. OK, what in cheney's background makes you think he's the puppeteer and bush is the
puppet?
The bush family's link to power goes way back, to the Civil war and railroad era.
Cheney's goes back to...cheney. Unless you know something I don't.
63. Even the Bush
family knew W needed help moving his lips. Enter Cheney.
66. and you know the bush family's secret thoughts because....
72. and you know the bush family's secret thoughts because....
Because there are no secrets involved and we can see and hear and have a brain.
How 'bout you?
73. weak.  *you* think bush is dumb &amp; needs a minder, ergo cheney is in charge.  to you,
that means "we can see and hear and have a brain".
or maybe not. just your supposition.
74. Oh please.....
...... what are you even arguing about?
Like we're making scientific analyses instead of snarky jokes.
And having lived thru the Bush years, and having a memory, it was obvious Dubya was not that engaged with that whole governing thing (one page DPB's...he didn't even read, y'know). Not so good for press conferences and PR either but it's what they got. He, like Reagan was a PR President.... a GOP idea.
But
Yes yes, I cannot see into the Bush family collective brain. Nothing about decades of external behavior or incidences and verbiages could possibly give us a clue as to what they are like or how they operate. THANK YOU, ND-Dem, for being so fair and understanding. I grovel.... I grovel in mortification...
79. You do know who picked Cheney to be W's VP, don't you? n/t
2. There's no question how ISIS came about.  These are former
disgruntled Iraqi military officers (under Saddam) and AQ-aligned Sunnis who were too hard to kill the first time around. They went underground like cockroaches and then got the band back together a few years later. It's really that simple.
70. You summed it up perfectly in sound bite form
Bravo!
76. Yes and anyone stupid enough to support those aholes and vote for the IWR is disqualified to be President...
Can everyone at least agree on that?!
3. What this photo says to me:
heil
5. i wish it was saying "bye-bye we're off to the hague"
18. It says "Smile nice for the camera, Georgie, and you can have ice cream after your nap"
to me ...
43. Sprinkles are for winners.
49. Off topic...
but I love that commercial. "Flo" delivers that line so deadpan.
on edit: Added the video for those who haven't seen it. She makes him feel so good for 25 seconds, then buries the knife
52. Never put this creature on my screen again.
I am so sick of that ******* "Flo", I could retch when I see her mug.
(nuttin' personal, awoke!)
53. Ah, come on now....
I hear you, though
60. you're not alone ...
n/t
4. kr
6. Populist President Obama is what we have in power, no need to wait for Warren. Get his back.
42. How exactly is he a "Populist President".  His stands on fracking, the TPP,
indefinite detention, the Patriot Act, torture, war crimes, drone killings, persecution of whistle-blowers and journalists, etc., preclude him from being a "Populist President". Sen Warren wants to control Wall Street, while Pres Obama and Holder are willing to give them a pass. Almost all of Pres Obama's appointees have been conservatives. How again is he "Populist"???
7. ahhh, so this is what prompted Cheney's little outburst
I figured it had something to do with questioning his lying, cheating, reign of terror.
What a petulant man-child
8. Too bad 99.5% of the population will never see nor read this.
45. Oh, they're reading it and, from what I've seen in the social media, people are furious at Obama.
How dare he not accept the blame for ISIS and blame Bush/Cheney on top of that!
When will these liberals (the fact these goofs call Obama a liberal is laughable) start owning up to their mistakes (another good laugh at their skills of projecting).
I've been reading it on FB and other social media for the past day.
10. The easiest, best and most important thing to do
In letting the world and American citizens know that we realize how horrible what we did was, is to prosecute those that committed war crimes.
11. Shithole RT using a real news organizations work....
There should be some kind of international law against that LOL
12. Bush tried to keep us in, kept Gitmo open, and used ultra-Salafists to overthrow Libya and Syria?
48. How sweet.. you're sticking up for bush.
13. IF ONLY we had media that would actually report on this disturbing fact so the President
wouldn't have to. Now it becomes political when it an actual fact.
If only that librul media would do their job.
14. Working on ensuring no bush will ever hold public office again, awesomeness.
16. YES!   n/t
17. If you want to go back further
Really the CIA in Afghanistan was who birthed the large multi national Islamic fighting force that first formed in Afghanistan, then moved to the former Yugoslavia, and finally wound up in Iraq and Syria. You could say we gave the seed money, and really our invasion of Iraq and then what went down in Syria gave it a huge shot in the arm.
I really only think that it can currently be defeated on an ideological basis and by not sending arms to the middle east, because the arms can be captured or sold to them from who we originally give them to. Another important part is to become energy independent. I think Obama actually knows this and is quietly trying to both do it and educate the public. However the GOP, and sadly, too many of our countrymen think that force is somehow an option that will work.
For years after Vietnam we understood this reality. However one bad thing I think about the Gulf War and our success there was that it sort of emboldened the hawks. After the self congratulatory wallowing we were doing after the Gulf War went so well, combined with the fall of the USSR I knew our imperialistic and hawkish elements were going to lead the country down the path of problems again.
19. The war in Kuwait was when Papa put the airfields on Saudi land
infuriating the dormant extremists, namely Bin Laden and ilk.
20. ...
21. why in the hell is the gnewz telling us what stupid head cheeney thinks?
22. Bzzzzzt! This is an RT article and therefore is simply Russian propaganda!
or something like that...
K&amp;R
23. Educate them over there so we don't have to fight them over here.
24. There is a lot of blame to go around
I found Frontline's program "The Rise of Isis" quite interesting.
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/rise-of-isis/
38. It seemed a bit Hawkish to put U.S. troops on the ground. I don't want to see more young people
killed and or beheaded. We have to encourage the surrounding armies (Sauds etc) to take up the cause. If they want stability in the region then they'll have to step up. The Pentagon loves war as well as the MIC (Military Industrial Complex)
39. I don't know what the solution is
and I don't want to see troops on the ground either. My point in posting the link was to show the blame goes beyond Bush. Obama played a role as well through neglect and ignoring Malaki's purges of the Sunni. The whole thing is a royal screw up, and now we are facing the consequences.
25. Let's give Obama a THIRD TERM as President
Have Pelosi and Reid introduce a Bill to bomb some place that republicans hate, like the MSNBC studio during the weekend so Rachel is safe, and then like the republicans, sneakily bury a sentence in the Bill that allows Obama to run for a third term. He's too good to let go so soon.
Let's do it!
28. A great "I told you so" would be for Obama to be followed by a Walker or Cruz
The stark difference would make some people hang their heads in shame
We were shown this difference when Obama (superman in some respects) took over after W, the worst president of all time.
We saw how different it was and we forgot about it so quickly, some of us did, anyway.
30. Uh...Bad idea.
Allowing an axe murderer in the house because your kids make a mess and talk back ....isn't a very good idea.
29. hear, hear!
34. I've been "threatening" by
conservative friends with a Third Obama term for six years now! Drives them crazy!!
Sounds like a great idea to me .... (except for that constitutional thing.)
57. Michelle.
Third and fourth Obama terms. Beats the alternatives.
27. kicking, rec, shared.   n/t
31. Hillary blamed the rise of ISIS on Obama's "failure" to intervene in Syrian civil war.
http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/hillary-clinton-failure-to-help-syrian-rebels-led-to-the-rise-of-isis/375832/
41. ...and here I was...
thinking that I didn't need another reason to hate Hillary.
44. There's plenty of material no doubt.
Obama could have left her dumb ass in the Senate where she chaired no committees and had no seniority. But he gave her actual foreign policy experience as SOS to bolster her resume that largely consisted of fantastical claims such as bringing peace to Ireland and ducking sniperfire in Tuzla. What does he get for his gracious generosity? She stabs him in the back and self-promotes her hawkish views. She forgets she lost in large part because of her hawkishness, so I look forward to a reckoning that is surely headed her way.
58. What is striking is that HRCs positions are Bibis and the Saudis
She makes that quite clear in her interview that the "maximalist" stance she takes on every issue from Israel's bombing of Gaza to Iran enrichment is essentially the same as Bibi's and the Saudis'.
As she admits, "there is no distance" on these matters - Hillary might as well be Bibi or the Saudi foreign minister.
Does no one else find this remarkable? Are we really expected to quietly accept her nomination as the Democratic candidate for President without even discussion?
65. Yes, it is disturbing.
And ignored for the most part by too many here.
It is my #1 reason, and lord knows there are many, why I cannot and will not vote for her.
67. Thanks for the link to that HRC interview in The Atlantic.  Substantiates a lot ME specifics.
Hillary has been enabling the "maximalist" hard-line positions of the Israeli RW and the Saudis, and will by all indication continue to do so. Clinton, along with the GOP neocons, share responsible for much of the chaos and sectarian violence that is spilling over out of the region. That fact is widely ignored around here. Let's see what we can do about that.
80. I'm in.
Let's see what we can do about that.
75. Thanks for the link
God, I hope Bernie Sanders becomes a Democrat and runs against HRC for the Democratic nomination.
77. Thanks AK for the reminder. With that idiocy and her IWR vote, Hillary succeeds only in embarrassing herself.
32. I think "unintended" is a real stretch.
I believe everything that happened was well planned and quite intentional.
35. +1000
56. yup. what better way to keep the war machine in high gear
than to bomb a country that did nothing to deserve it.
we should have invaded saudi arabia if we were really trying to punish the perpetrators of 9/11.
33. Average age of ISIL recruit is between 16-21
These are the children of the Iraq war.
Would be interesting to know how many ISIL fighters are orphans or had family killed during the Iraq war.
This was my biggest argument against the Iraq war that it would lead to a generation of children growing up with hate and vengence in their heart thus leading to more terrorism and war.
36. Chainee's ventriloquist act is something to see....
And with only one hand!!!
37. Excellent statements. K&amp;R
46. Pass the butter. It will be fun watching their heads explode.
47. The President warned them in Oct 2002 in his speech against invading Iraq.. did they listen? Are
you kidding!
Mahalo Miles
50. Is that Cheney's hand
up the back of W's shirt? The puppet master at work....
54. I thought we were told RT is a worthless source.
That should not even be allowed on DU. My, how time has changed.....
59. The interview is with Vice News, this story reports on that story. The OP used RT's reporting on
Vice News instead of just linking to the interview. Here's the source:
https://news.vice.com/video/president-obama-speaks-with-vice-news
71. Which is exactly what happened when many others have used RT.
But based on the subject matter they are slammed for using "Putin's propaganda". Here not so much....
62. i hate the picture of those two asswip..
pure evil
64. Certainly not unforeseen. And it was only 'unintended' in the sense that
the greedy, arrogant assholes in charge didn't really give a shit about such side effects. They had their short term goals and lots of dick to waggle, and they just barged forward and did it with the the acquiescence of the political establishment and lots of media cover.
68. Saddam was right.
69. Spot on! +1
78. Islamic State owes it's very existence to the Project for the New American Century (PNAC)
"PNAC, co-founded by William Kristol and Robert Kagan, was a neo-conservative think tank (1997-2006) that had strong ties to the American Enterprise Institute.
PNAC is noteworthy for it's focus on Iraq, a preoccupation that began before Bush became president and predates the attacks of September 11, 2001."
