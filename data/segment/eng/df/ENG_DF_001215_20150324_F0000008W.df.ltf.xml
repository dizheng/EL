I wonder if Hillary had a (R) after her name, would the left despise her and the right proclaim the obviousness of her superiority?
I will vote for a Republican over a democrat every time.
 think you missed half of your comparison.
The title should be. What is the difference between Hillary and Limburger cheese. Not much, they both stink and leave a terrible after taste
i refuse to vote for either. They both suck.
I'd like to see them suck muffler fumes.
I will vote for a Republican over a democrat every time.
And what will change? Will the government become more limited? Will there be more individual liberties? Will the state stop stealing your money?
Of course not. 
You'll keep rooting for your team because that's what fans do.

Tell you...stay home, don't do anything, just bitch and bitch and bitch some more because you will accomplish so much that way. Don't dare get involved in any Party and try to work from within.
You're right.
There is no difference.
Neither advocates LEGAL POT; and neither advocates anarchy.
So...there's no choice there.
...if your worldview is so compressed and deluded...

No, I wouldn't get involved in any party... I don't believe that any form of government benefits human civilization in any way. In fact I strongly believe it's detrimental. If I were to get involved in selecting a ruler, I'd be a hypocrite.
I'll let the sheep choose their master and laugh at their quandary... then I'll suffer from the same state they believe they control.
