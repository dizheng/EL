Bill Kristol: We may need to draft Netanyahu against Hillary

The Republican talking heads are starting to get nervous it seems.
Maybe the GOP will take a tip from Netanyahu's successful last-minute nativist racist scare tactic campaign pitch, when he warned of "Arabs voting in droves". Some GOPers have come close to that with various dog whistles (47%, 'urban voters,' 'takers,' etc), but will one actually say "Rise up and stop the Blacks and Mexicans from electing Hillary!"
Bill Kristol continues to give Dick Morris a run as most out of touch man in America.
New PPP poll will have Netanyahu at 2%. Just watch.
He is probably more popular in the US than a good half of the GOP field.
Apparently CNN doesn't know the difference between RV/LV voter polls and polls of national adults.
He is probably more popular in the US than a good half of the GOP field.
Probably because the GOP has been praising his name and the Democrats are too afraid to trash him because Israel.
In such scenario, I'd probably end up as Clintonbot, worse than IceSpear

That's not saying much at all.
How many times do you have to be totally wrong before people stop allowing you on television or quoting in you in otherwise respectable publications?

Even I would favor a Clinton victory in that scenario.
