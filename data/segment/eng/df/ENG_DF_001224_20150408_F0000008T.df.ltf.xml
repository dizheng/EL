Hey did you hear? Joker Tsarnaev was found guilty
:lol:
 
Now tell us something we didn't know
 
We all knew he was guilty.
 
All that has mattered since day 1,  is whether or not he will get the death penalty
 He and Hernandez should share a needle. 
 He and Hernandez should share a needle. 
Joker killed and wounded many, many innocent people.
No one in Mass has been put to death since 1947, or so the wikipedia of knowledge tells me. If there had been more deaths, I think it would be more possible, but with 3 deaths, I doubt this kid gets it. Life in prison, no parole. 
he'll get the death penalty, he should get tortured for life

are you not counting the 3 killed with he and his dirtbag brother's bombs?
As young as he is, he's looking at 60 years in SuperMax. That's worse than prison and worse than death.

That's an interesting question.
 
Where will he spend his life? what prison?

:rolleyes: Easy there Captain America
 
he'll get 3 consecutive life sentences for the 3 deaths, and 150 years or something like that for all the other charges.

I don't think there's any question. All domestic terrorists go to Florence Colorado's SuperMax... Kazinski, underwear bomber, John Walker, etc.

Just saying.
 
He didn't mind putting people to death, he should get the same

Mass does not have the death penalty but this is a federal case, still your point is a good one. 
Can citizens of this state put someone to death if they don't believe in it?
Isn't there an American Deserter out there that we can trade this kid for? He certainly is not as dangerous as the five terrorists we gave up for Bergdahl.

because the state doesn't have the death penalty, the citizens don't believe in it? :wacko:
 
As a rule I like to see there is solid evidence. For christ sakes, there is video of him placing the bomb. 
I am categorically opposed to the death penalty.
They should lock this piece of sh1t up for the rest of his life. Put him in solitary "for his own protection." 
Day in and day out for decades almost never leaving your cell or ever talking to another human being. A fate worse than death. He will wish with every ounce of his soul that he had a bedsheet or a shoelace or a belt with which to hang himself.
Conversely if you execute him he gets a quick and easy death as a martyr. No way, that's way too good for him.
Should put him in that ultra cool prison in face off

but you know this will never happen.

Why not? He sure as sh1t won't ever get parole if that's what you're saying 
Focker probably wants the death penalty, to be with his 1,000 virgins or whatever it says in his backwards religion.
Life in prison, no parole. :cheers: 
Even if he gets the death penalty, it'll be 20 years before it's carried out, with all the attendant appeals and cost of keeping death row inmates. Capital punishment is a stupid waste of resources.

I'm saying he will never be treated like that

They should just dig a hole out back of the courthouse and put a bullet in his head.   Cheap, easy, and fast.
I'm saying he will never be treated like that
I'd be surprised if he wasn't 
I am against the death penalty but I have no problem with this dude staring at a wall for the rest of his existence.
just found out that f&amp;cker automatically gets changed to dude
Franknbeans is a dude.

Nicely played

 Touch his ears and see. 
I don't care if he gets the death penalty or not.  But when he goes to prison, I don't want us giving him any special attention.   Simply open thew doors and say "Here you go.  Good luck".    I'd love to see him get the Jeffrey Dahmer treatment.
they should stick him in s room and blast his legs with thousands of ball bearing
then life in prison

People hate him and want to him to suffer, because he hated Americans and made them suffer. Ironic.

how is that ironic? he blew an 8 year old child up, got a link to any of his haters doing the same?

wow.
I understand the bloodthirsty desire for vengeance. But that's an emotional reaction rather than an intelligent one.

i see comments like this all over social media sh;t nowadays. wtf is even your point???
 
i weep for america :(
"Americans" has little to do with it for me... it's the  "children and families" that he hurt that bothers me so much.
 
And I guess it breaks down like this:
 
If anyone should ever be punished by death, this is the person. I don't think that is debatable.
The debate is simply the age-old death penalty debate. Should we kill the worst humans in the name of justice?
People hate him and want to him to suffer, because he hated Americans and made them suffer. Ironic. 
Ironic? Or obvious? If someone killed someone in your family, others in your family would want him dead.

I do too...so much talk of vengeance.
I get the guy is scum...but its sad how quickly people here throw out the constitution of this country to get revenge on someone.
