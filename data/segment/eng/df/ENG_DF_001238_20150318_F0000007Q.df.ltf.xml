Do British Muslims embarrass us internationally?
When you hear foreigners talking about the UK, it's not uncommon to hear them talk about our Muslim population and how frighteningly radical they are.
Young British Muslims are going abroad in droves to fight and young British Muslim women are even going abroad to become the fighters' brides.
Many terrorist plots have been foiled where British Muslims either helped plan or carry out the attack - Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the underwear bomber, are just two recent high profile examples.
Probably the most prominent Islamic terrorist in the world right now, Jihadi John AKA Mohammed Emwazi, is British-raised and has brutally executed innocent people of various nationalities whilst spewing hate in a British accent.
Groups like CAGE actively defend people like Jihadi John who was called a "beautiful young man" by one CAGE activist.
High profile hate preachers like Anjem Choudary and Abu Hamza have made the UK their home and are free to say disgusting things knowing they're protected by our free speech laws.
There is a huge amount of anti-semitism amongst UK Muslims with 39 percent of attacks on Jews in the UK committed by "Asians" or "Arabs" (Muslims).
Polls have shown huge amounts of support amongst British Muslims for disgusting things like the execution of apostates, homosexuals and adulterers - especially amongst younger Muslims.
When this is the way British Muslims are seen around the world, should we as a country be embarrassed?
I don't feel embarrassed. They're not my fault.
I don't feel embarrassed. They're not my fault.
I just can't help feeling a little bit embarrassed. :/
Nah the non Muslim population do a good job of that themselves. 
And for your information, CAGE do not support Jihadi John. He was called 'beautiful' before he turned into the person he now is. 
So get your facts right.

I doubt, given the extreme levels of psychopathy demonstrated, that there has actually been a huge transition in this person's personality. He was probably always a psychopath and a "beautiful" one at that.

Was the CAGE activist Afghan by any chance?
I think Britain has embarrassed itself enough with the atrocities committed all around the world throughout history and in modern times.
As a British Muslim, the radicalised ones embarrass us even further. Being 20, at uni, brown and Muslim, I'm seen as a potential radical thanks to these guys -_-
(I can't do much, I'm not in an influential position, and not involved in the wider British Muslim community)

They kinda do. Asim Qureshi called him “extremely kind, extremely gentle and the most humble young person I ever knew”, blamed his radicalisation solely on the intelligence services (as opposed to his religion which, obviously has nothing at all to do with it) and generally painted an extremely sympathetic picture of a guy who is a cold-blooded murderer.
I think it's only the ones who voice their radical views publicly. Most Muslims are perfectly nice people.

No idea.

Yeah, it has to suck being a moderate Muslim when you have a very vocal minority making you all look like extremists. :/
hahahaha, Britain and many other countries have committed so many barbaric acts in the past, should we not feel embarrassed by those? Think it's important to realize that by having this sort of mindset where you're generalizing an enormous group of people as a result of the (inhumane) acts of others, the problem isn't going to be solved any time soon

They should be embarrassed about themselves. I have nothing but contempt for ***** like Abu Hamza.
No idea.

the worst is when people who hate Muslims expect you apologise for them. I don't even follow the same sect as them, and don't know them, what the hell?! :/
Nah the non Muslim population do a good job of that themselves. 
Yeah, Agreed.
The Brits are quite good at doing that themselves, regardless.

Agreed. Nice goal on Monday btw mate. :yy:

People having...... FUN?!?!?! That is embarassing!
Terrorists are not Muslim,you forget the fact that these terrorists have killed more Muslims than any other race or religion through suicide bombings and school massacres in their own country .
Then we go in with America and not expect a backlash.
We killed almost millions of civilians in their countries and some (American soliders)even took pictures of dead childrens bodies in burning cars
We supplied arms to isis when ASAD was gasing his own people.
A better question would be
Should we feel embarrassed that we blindly followed America into those countries on US intelligence that was blurred and then killed more innocent people in the crossfire?
Yes
Should we feel ashamed by British Muslims ? 
No,the majority don't take the Quran that literal 
Lets look at it from another perspective if their was a bully at school who just terrorizes the weaker kids just for the fact his father told him"You either be the bully or get bullied" and his mother said the complete opposite.Who would you blame if the child violently beat up another child The bully ,the bully dad or both parents.​Or all of them?
To be honest I'm more embarrassed about our country's role in going to war in Iraq and Afghanistan and successfully destabilising the region and leaving it more dangerous than it was before. Now that my man is embarassing

That's not true. Psychopaths were once normal people. Sometimes it only takes one event to completely change a person's life around. 
They kinda do. Asim Qureshi called him “extremely kind, extremely gentle and the most humble young person I ever knew”, blamed his radicalisation solely on the intelligence services (as opposed to his religion which, obviously has nothing at all to do with it) and generally painted an extremely sympathetic picture of a guy who is a cold-blooded murderer.
No they don't. 
If you read my previous post I said those comments praising him was before he started all these beheadings. 
Family and friends of murderers all the time paint a nice picture of someone who they once knew as a nice, kind person etc. This really isn't an uncommon thing.
