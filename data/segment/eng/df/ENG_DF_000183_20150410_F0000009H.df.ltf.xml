Dear Hillary Clinton Supporters To-The-Core DUers.
This discussion thread was locked asoff-topicby Sissyk (a host of the General Discussion forum).
As Hillary Clinton is expecting to announce after tommorow I certainly understand your excitement.
Nontheless although I know how hard you wilk work for her and to avoid a Reich Winger enter Oval Office after Barack Obama I woulf like to ask to you..
Please accept DU comlunity members dont share your wiews and your wish to see her elected. Accept critics and advises. Accept the fact that not all Dems are expecting her as the Only One Viable. Every primary candidates has his/her streghths and weaknesses
Please act a little bit less harsh to those who diss Clinton now-overhelming lead.
Convention is way months ahead.
The battle of the primary has to bre real and equal for the sake of good and fair political process.
1. Let the battle royal commence.
Gentlemen and Lady, on your mark!
Get set!
Go!
4. Did you mean, "Let the hyperbole commence"?
20. I decided to use an obvious and intentional exageration after reading the OP.
42. Well done.  I'm here in my undisclosed location hiding out from the evil HRC supporters.
2. Some of the kindest posters here support Clinton.
They have received nothing but ire, like this post.
Go to the Clinton group. The names I see there are some of DUs best posters. There is one I even envy due to their patience and kindness. I don't understand how they do it.
So I really don't know where this is coming from.
5. you think this op is "ire"?  strikes me as a respectful post
and who and who isn't "du's best posters" is entirely subjective.
16. Cali, you flat out know this wasn't posted in honest. nt.
26. what the heck are you talking about?  How is it not honest?
31. History.
When this poster makes claims against Clinton that are so laughable that they delete their own posts, it is clear. If Clinton takes populist stances during the campaign are you going to jump up and down and say yes? No, you aren't. Neither will I. Why? History. Yet op with a history like this get a free pass.
38. I am not familiar with his/her posts.
27. It occurs to me that a post written using a teabagger/right wing dictionary may have bee intended as
an attempt at a subtle attack.
But I let it pass.
6. Really?  This post counts as 'ire'?
9. They see what suits their agenda.
14. "only one viable"
You use coded language pretending to be informative.
The whole post comes off as condescending.
Hillary supporters have been getting "criticism" for years, what happens between now and when she announces changes nothing for them.
33. I agree with this...
and I'm not even a big fan of Hillary.
The non stop hammering of her supporters is crazy. As if the people they support (with one exception Bernie) don't have a few bones in their closet. Who needs the pukes we beat each other up better than they ever could.
We can have policy discussions without all the name calling--or wait--apparently we can't.
Again...not a big fan of Hillary.
36. As far as Im cincerned..
My OPs xritics Clinton Supremacy.
I am not in anyway "hammering"
supporters
Or if so... well please accept my apology.
When I say she is too much frienfly towards Kussinger , for instance.... I doesnt mean I label Clinton supporters as Kissinger lovers or somewhat.
35. Sorry, have to disagree.....
if you're too gentle, then you're 'condescending'? So poster should have been more confrontational?
3. I second that!
7. Dear mylye222,
Could I ask the same of you?
Could we have fewer posts about other DUers and more about policy differences?
Yours,
Nancy
17. +1
18. +1
At a minimum.
22. This
23. Agreed
25. +1
Just a tad obsessive, IMO...
8. Be wary.
The purge will come. No reasoned thinking or less than glowing approvals will be allowed. Yield to the machine or be gone.
10. Exact.
And I have been told it was the same tactics in 2008.
11. When people spread obnoxious lies about Hillary, they will be called out, harshly.
Sorry, no kid gloves from me.
12. Extra butter on mine, please.
13. Playing innocent is fun isn't it? lol nt.
15. And what am I guilty of please???
OH yes. Not following the majority....
19. That's it. nt.
28. Oh really?
So wishing someone lefftyer, less WS friendly candidate ( my dream would be Sanders) is making me "guilty"?
Guilty of not aknowledging to what seems to me more like a motoriety based candidacy than a one when candidate needs to convince?
37. How's politics in France these days?You say you are a "Dem" which means registered to vote in the US
....more or less, but as you are, if I recall correctly, a French national, that is not precisely possible.
We welcome most opinions here, from all countries. As you well should know. It makes the conversation not only more interesting but more informative.
However, when a person has only one tune to play (Hillary is all things bad), slips into RW terms (Queen Hillary), and offers no actual policies or other candidates to talk about ....
So I ask again, as I have before this, how's things where you are aside from the Le Pens? I understand there's a growing tide of anti-Semitism in France just now, for starters.
43. Politics in France now are shittt
I am a progressive supporting the lest wing of Socialist party ( social democrats)
I voted for Hollande but whished a more prigressive. Now our govt is continuing austerity crap. Sarkozy us a corrupted crook. And Le Pens are frightening.
44. Uh huh
21. This is how you followup your "Hillary Supporters control DU" and Clintons control the Party OPs ???

How about some more truth in advertising? I could have respected you a lot more if you had written:
"Well, I've already got some of my bombthrowing in against Hillary and her supporters and I will probably throw some more, but please don't throw any back and treat me with kid gloves."
At least that would have been accurate.
24. Dear anti-Clinton crowd,
Hillary will now be officially running for president. It might upset some of you, but then that's life. She has the right to run just as much as any other registered Democrat who wishes to enter the race.
If anything, the poor sportsmanship has been exhibited by the rabid anti-Hillary posts that I have read here ever since before Obama even became president, some of them using RW talking points. That's why many Hillary supporters have left this site for friendlier pastures.
Therefore, personally, I don't give a flying fig about anyone's opinion about Hillary on this site. Vote for her, don't vote for her, your choice. I will certainly not waste my time trying to convince folks who would rather sit on their hands than cast a vote for her. I will be far too busy volunteering for her campaign.
I do know one thing though, I will be damned if I don't vote for the Democratic candidate in 2016, be it Hillary or someone else. The stakes are far too high. The rest of you can do whatever you want.
30. She absolutely has the right to run.  Has any DUer suggested otherwise?
34. Plenty here act as if she were the anti-Christ, it got tiresome a long time ago.
No one is forcing anyone to support her during the primaries, but a pox on those who have repeatedly said that they will refuse to vote for her if she's the party's nominee. I would vote for any Democrat over the pile of manure who will be the Republican nominee.
41. + 100
29. Yeah!  Be nice to those who diss Clinton!...
Sid
32. When the mud starts flying...
I will probably disappear again. The primaries fights get very ugly around here.
39. No mud here.. just lovely...
40. Ofercrissake... grow up.
45. Locking.
