Congrat Buhari.... Nigeria's President-elect
The election 2015 has been won and lost with the incumbent defeated. I congratulate the winner General Muhammadu Buhari, his party and his supporters for pulling such feat of defeating an incumbent for the first time in Nigeria. Though the PDP is contesting some of the results announced in FOUR States, yet it is a victory that deserves celebration for the APC except the Court decide otherwise.
With respect to my eleventh hour defection to the PDP camp, let me reiterate that I have no regret for my decision. I have to also state that I was never compromised by any political party or government to influence my change of camp. I was passionate for APC and Buhari then, I am passionate for GEJ and the reformed PDP now. I wish Buhari well in the running of his government. My integrity is more important than anything. 
To the PDP, I urge them to take the electoral defeat as an opportunity to re-build the party and make it attractive to patriotic Nigerians. The unpopular people in the party need to be phased out for new breed of smart, passionate, patriotic and young politicians. If they have any complaint, the legal process should be explored and not the show of shame as acted by Mr Godsday Orubebe.
To President Jonathan, He lost the popular votes but he kept to his word of not interfering with the process. I sympathise with him and all supporters for his loss at the poll. The most important and honorable thing is that he be ready to handover power come May 29. He should resist any advice from any quarter to perpetuate himself in power beyond the May 29 expiry date.
As for my Brothers and Sisters in the SS and SE, I urge them to accept the will of the people but be rest assured that the struggle for better living will not end with Jonathan's exit from power. We shall continue to demand for better living of our people and the entire Nigerians. 
I congratulate General Buhari once again,his numerous supporters and party. I wish Buhari well in his incoming administration.
God Bless Us All

cheesy cheesy
The turncoat has turned up.
You lose Obasanjo, you lose Amaechi, You lose saraki, You lose el-rufai and you have Fani-Kayode and Fayose. How do you expect to win election?
Finally FFK don bow 
But hey dude! your reputation is gone on this board.
And what happened in the FOUR states?
Your road was tough, but you did an excellent job.
You never lost your faith and courage, which
eventually brought you to success.
Congratulations.

Finally FFK don bow

Fayose go bow pass am!
It was a clueless move when u left APC and more clueless was ur description of GMB,in one of ur posts after leaving APC,as insincere.
However,the door of change never closes for any upright mind.
Barcanista u dnt belong to them.Accept ur mistakes and move on.You are still not as bad as FFK for god's sake.
Looking forward to ur coming back to where u belong.Dont mind what they will say,mind what's right.
Nice one bro.....
God bless Nigerians
God bless Nigeria.

Heheheheheheheh......hoooooooooooo...hahahahahahahahahhaah....Chai. I no fit laff alone o
Lmaooooooooo
Barcanista, how market? 
Your betrayal of APC and joining the TANoids was of great benefit to the progressives. The entire Webosphere saw the kind of characters supporting JonaTAN. Traitors, turncoats, liars, and those ready to sell their birthright for mere pittance. 
Your posts against Jonathan in the early days made many to reject Jonathan, but your defection made more undecided voters see through the garment of deceit clothing you and your ilk. 
Your disservice was your greatest service to the Buhari cause. 
Thank you very much as you take your ignoble position in the dustbin of history.

Be rest assured that being in opposition is not a new adventure for me. PDP being the new opposition, we shall together build the party across board, appreciate the good policies of the incoming government but will never shy of keeping them to their feet. Election has come and gone. The mandate has been given, we have no choice but to respect the will of the people.
Hahahah

Nice one bro.....
God bless Nigerians

Congratulations bros, God Bless You Much More.
Even if your belief in GMB's candidacy wavered , going back to PDP who you had castigated put you in bad light, a reasonable person would have abstained from the election altogether, but by going back to ur vomit, you showed us your views about pdp all this while was fake, you yourself didn't belief your own views or principles, you just wanted popularity. Well you have your popularity now, there is no difference between you and FFK, and Nigerians have shown that they don't want the likes of you, if u were to get to power, you probably will have no principles or ideology. I don't take you serious anymore, I'm only replying this so as to dissuade those who might be decieved by your new gestures . 
I wish you Goodluck
