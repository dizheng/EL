15 dead in attack at Kenyan University
They went around asking who was Christian and who was Muslim and shot the Christians. It is believed to be Al Shabab. 800 students were believed to have been inside 280 accounted for. I wonder what will be the reaction of the Kenyan government to this. There has been harassment and deportation of Somalis in Kenya and this could well be stepped up.
Rip.
These Wahabi salafists really hate Christians.
Meanwhile America is helping Saudi Arabia, the home of Wahabi-ism, to bomb the houthis of Yemen.
A murderous attack carried about by Jihadi's.
The Free Syrian Army will be happy with their ''brothers'' work.
Rip.
Is that weasel acronym the best you can do in the face of yet another outrage carried out in the name of a certain rancid religion/political ideology ?

Neither Saudi Arabia or the Free Syrian Army is linked with Al Shabab.

I wouldn't dignify that excretion with an answer.
The "religion of peace" strikes again. And no surprise to see the lunatic Parry on here blaming Murica for this. What that gobshyte fails to remember is that the US is bombing Al-Kebab in Somalia. What the fukk is his own country Russia doing to stop Islamic barbarians?" Sweet FA that's what!

The ''Free Syrian Army'' is nothing more than an umbrella term for a bunch of jihadist factions.
Islamist terrorists, just like Al Shabab.
