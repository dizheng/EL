President Obama and President Castro of Cuba spoke by phone in the first known conversation between leaders of the two countries in over 50 years.
"Sup."
"Not much. Chillin."

Eyy, hombre, hit me up with some of those cigars
It's funny because I don't think Obama would actually talk like that
I know right? A lot of people forget that he is from the middle east (Hussein).
He's not from the middle east. Hussein is an Islamic name, from his Indonesian Dad. Err, wait, secret muslim manchurian candidate. That's it. Totally.
Two dictators.
He's from America, actually.
Pretty sure they are making a joke.
Well. Whoosh for me.
Middle name! Middle east! It's all coming together now!
My god this is the start this is what JRRT meant. Middle earth is happening.
Thanks, Obama.
Jet Fuel Can Melt Steel Feels! Cheney and Biden are reverse vampires!
Except he's not. He's from Hawaii
"Uuuuuh...I think, that. Some of those cigars...would be good!
...
So could you uuuuh...send some over"
Wagwan Jamaica.
Did you see the video from Obama's trip to Kingston? He started the speech in patois -- "Whaa gwan Jamaica". It was surreal.
I was reading in cigar aficionado that the quality of the cigars isn't what it once was. Partly due to the older generation not passing the skills down as there was no (foreseeable) future in their sales
A lot of them also moved to other Central American countries after the embargo.
I hear Nicaraguans are supposed to be the new best.
This is the better answer - the reason Cubans were the best was that other markets were nascent or not that great.
Fortunately non-Cuban cigars are now excellent and much cheaper. I still love Cubans but if you want to have great cigars you still have plenty of great options from $5 to $50 without having to go Cuban.

Alot moved to the DR with seeds right when Castro took power. It was the closest to Cuban soil and sunlight. Thus why you have cigar companies with the same names as the Cuban equivalent.
Wine is priced often proportionately to how well it's rated by "distinguished" judged, but when the judged are blinded cheap and pricy stuff aren't distinguishable. Is there any "blind" study on cigar judges, as far as you know..??
And the whole Communism thing. Doesn't tend to keep quality control high.
Whatcha doin?
Nothin just presidential stuff.
Same here. How's Michelle?
She's good, just munchin' on some carrots.
Cool story bro.
Dude, did you see Putin's suit last week at the meeting? That guy has no style. Whoever chose that tie for him deserves the gulag.
I liked it when your American Show about the card house made fun of him!
Ikr? The only difference is that Michelle would leave him in the floor crying for mommy and a bottle of vodka.
Tired. How's Beyonce?
Did Michelle make it home safely this morning?
Chillin, killing.
True, true.
Ah, yes. I know what you mean. I got some robots for that now.

So that's why we were trying to get Elian Gonzalez, leverage.
