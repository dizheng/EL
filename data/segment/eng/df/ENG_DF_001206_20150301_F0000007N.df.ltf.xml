I was watching an interview with Garry Kasparov this morning:

and he described the fear critics had even before Nemtsov's murder. If the name Garry Kasparov sounds familiar then you were chess aware in the 80s. Kasparov was one of the youngest world champion chess phenoms ever and became famous for his chess game against the IBM computer Deep Blue. It also cost his chess organization it's major sponsorship from Intel as IBM was their biggest rival at that time.
I am saddened that this assassination is just another example of people dying for justice at the hands of cowards. I'll say it over and over again, those whose truth isn't good enough, or strong enough will act out by lying or even violence because they are a coward that isn't mature enough to handle reality.
Not surprising if it's true. Scapegoating has become the sport of presidents and kings.

Same as that White House aid that riled Ms Clinton? Vince Foster? Witnesses came forward that LBJ had at least 6 people rubbed out.
