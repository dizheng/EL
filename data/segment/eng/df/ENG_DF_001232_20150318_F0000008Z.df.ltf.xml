Terrorist Group Confusing Me.
Can't figure out if it's me, the govt., the newscasters, or the terrorists themselves, but I'm confused. Every day I see snatches of news reports about this group of terrorists called ISIS. Problem is that sometimes they are called ISIS, sometimes called ISIL and sometimes just IS.
Are they all the same group or different groups? Do you start out as an IS and work your way up to an ISIS or ISIL?
Or is it like living in Canada where one day you can be a Canadian, but the next day a Canuck?
My understanding is that they are basically the same, just depending on where the pieces of crap are operating. ISIS is the islamic state in iraq and syria. The L is libya and IS is the general useless movement. Want to know how I really feel about them? lol
The L does not stand for Libya. It is "the Levant". ( No not Ezra, look it up)
IS is the name the group adopted worldwide
ISIS= Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
ISIL= Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( commonly used by US State Department
Essentially they are "Prince' of the terrorist community
"The terrorist group formerly known as........."
Thanks guys. Guess it kinda makes sense as much as any of thier BS makes sense.
they are all a little out there
To simplify:
ISIS = ISIL = IS
3 different names to describe the same demon. Abbreviations are mentioned above.
Couple of years back, they were our heroes, fighting against the "unjust" regimes in Lybia and Syria. Now Assad is not such a bad guy.  Those people bitching about the situation in Egypt, better give their heads a shake. If the Muslim Brotherhood had their way, it would be another Iran. Middle East politics are whacky to say the least.

That is for sure!

Don't get confused.. Its just one gruop. ISIS
There's a pakastani taliban that differs from the original taliban in afghanistan. Related, yes. Same original group? No. Just offshoots of each other. Like ISIS was "Al Qaeda in Iraq" til the original AQ disowned them and they became ISIS/ISIL.

Oh my, ha, ha, ha, ha.
It's meant to be confusing waterninja. ISIL is real but it stemmed from the illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003 for the most part. Don't believe me? Maybe Obama will explain it better... McCain knew it was coming as well. 
ISIL is a direct outgrowth of Al-Qaeda in Iraq that grew out of our invasion. Which is an example of unintended consequences. Which is why we should generally aim before we shoot.
Oh look, a video of his interview - FF to 11:45

Now look at the BS in North Africa, Gaddafi in Libya, the overthrow in Egypt. The over throw in Ukraine, the list goes on and on. 
And what is the result of all the crap? Arm sales are gone through the roof. Create an enemy - real and perceived - then monetize it. That's the game. 
Propaganda needs no truth. 
Hermann Goering played the terrorism card very well - and hung for his atrocities. People ask why we don't learn from the past? Because it works and terror laws in Canada are a case in point. Frighten the population and you can do what you want. 
"Why of course the people don't want war. Why should some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally the common people don't want war neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country."
Wait for bill C-51 to kick in.
