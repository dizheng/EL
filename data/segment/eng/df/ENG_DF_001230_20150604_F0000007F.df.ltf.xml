When they mean "sacrifice" ... they really mean paying every money they have to make sure the election favor them...
Not surprise that he knew the result before the announcement .....
the best rigger won last election undecided
Absolutely correct. In order to win the election, they had to put personal interests aside and adopt the most popular candidate, knowing that's the only chance they had at clinching at the presidency. They should also be prepared to make more sacrifices because Buhari is not someone you push around using selfish interest, he cares about his hard earned reputation and legacies and he wants to deliver without much interference...

I understand totally what he is saying.
I was blocked by some friends on social media and even lost someone I thought was a potential date because of my love for Buhari.
All in all, I have not one single regret! smiley
Thank God Nigeria, and by extension APC, is now being seen by countries of the world as a case study in devicing ways on how Opposition can win elections. 
Kudos should also go to Jonathan, atleast he no be stubborn person...I think those people coming to understudy how APC won the elections should go and meet Tinubu, guess he has the password on how to unlock very stubborn sit-tight regimes....he did it to OBJ and also GEJ...
