Trouble in the land of Barry's birth
Given the circumstances, he's probably OK with it:
Al-Shabaab reportedly claims responsibility for deadly attack on Kenyan college
They attacked Kenyon College?
Hopefully, the violence didn't spill over into the boxes HUSSEIN'S family lives in.

That could cause catastrophic losses in the dollars.

Full of aspiring constitutional scholars, I'm sure.
Over 70 Christians dead, workplace violence in the fatherland!
So Al-Shababb, Boko Haram, Al Queda, and ISIS are all joined together and slaughtering Christians or Non-Muslims. Obama and Kerry are willfully giving the Persians the Bomb. The Middle East is in flames and Israel is being backed into a corner and will have to make preemptive strikes...
I got money that says Barry is glued to ESPN and won't miss a minute of the Final Four with his buddy Al...

I'm sorry, but I just laughed out loud in the office...  Big Grin

Possibly in the dozens!
Death toll may be up to 150.....

Of all the stupid reasons to kill someone or be killed, religious pissing matches have to be right up there as the most ridiculous.

So if someone invades you in the name of religion, you shouldn't resist? Like all those Yazidis in Iraq?

Of course you should! Killing an invader or someone threatening your life is in no way stupid. The original premise for the invasion on the basis of religion is VERY stupid.

I agree. "My imaginary friend is better than your imaginary friend."
F'in whackos

Well, to some, it is far more important than "imaginary". I don't have a problem with it until they start killing to impose their beliefs on others.
I'm a simple person and I believe our military is there to smite evil. This is pure evil.
Obama released a statement about the massacre that did not mention Islam, Muslims, or even Christians. It was just some unfortunate massacre that occurred due to some unknown reason.

Michelle and I join the American people in expressing our horror and sadness at the reports coming out of Garissa, Kenya. Words cannot adequately condemn the terrorist atrocities that took place at Garissa University College, where innocent men and women were brazenly and brutally massacred. We join the world in mourning them, many of whom were students pursuing an education in the pursuit of a better life for themselves and their loved ones. They represented a brighter future for a region that has seen too much violence for far too long. We also commend the heroism of the responders who lost their lives in the selfless protection of the students and faculty. 
I know firsthand the extraordinary resilience and fundamental decency of the people of Kenya. So I know that the people of Garissa and all of Kenya will grieve, but their determination to achieve a better and more secure future will not be deterred. And neither will the resolve of the United States. We will stand hand-in-hand with the Kenyan Government and people against the scourge of terrorism and in their efforts to bring communities together. This much is clear: the future of Kenya will not be defined by violence and terror; it will be shaped by young people like those at Garissa University College â€“ by their talents, their hopes, and their achievements. This is a message I will relay to the Kenyan people when I visit Kenya in July. Even at this difficult hour, the Kenyan people should know they have an unwavering friend and ally in the United States of America.
I understand on Easter Sunday Obama took the opportunity to comment on "less than kind Christians".
Obama is a fraud in so many ways.
