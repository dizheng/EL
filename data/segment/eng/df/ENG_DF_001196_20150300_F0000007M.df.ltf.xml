Why didn't Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu wait till after the Israeli elections to travel to the USA to lecture in congress?
And speak with Barack Obama

He was invited to speak at a certain time. It's not necessarily something Netanyahu has control over: All he had control over was whether or not he'd agree to speak, which he did. I suppose it would've been better to wait until after he spoke, but there probably would still be controversy particularly between the Republicans and Democrats in their spat and with the White House not signing off of it.
Because when he wins the election he will be busy being a leader, unlike Obama the golfer!
He was invited for that date ,leaders of other nations have spoken at U.S. Congress just before elections were held in their respective nations
Netanyahu is hoping his visit to Washington DC will get him some extra votes
netanyahu is on his way out . he wants to get his two cents in before he is voted out . he wants to complain about obama negotiating with iran . he would much rather the US blow up iran . so if he has a problem with iran , why does israel get to sit back and not lift a finger ? why does he want to throw it off on us ?
The republicans are taking US policy advice from foreign leaders because the American leader elected by the people doesn't suit them.
Republicans are acting like racist. They have tried everything to stop Obama and he is trying for peace between the people. Republicans dont want his peace so they bow to Net and Putin.
Poor baby! IS he feewing BY-PASSED? Aw. Those evil Republicans act like it is THEY who hold absolute power over Americans!
More people will watch his speech than the Chicago community organizer will ever enjoy.
