Do you think Putin had anything to do with Boris Nemstov's death?
No he is personally in charge of the investigation into matter. The fact that it happened on a street that leads from the Kremlin to the Presidential Offices is pure coincidence. It might have been RasPutin
NOOoooo - Good ole Boris is a sweet heart... Just ask any Ukrainian....
Hard to Say... But a passing Ghost just warned me -that there be Something "rotten"- in Moscow... :o
Yes, and I also think the sky is blue and the sun rises in the East.
I wasnt there. I wouldnt rule it out knowing this man.
