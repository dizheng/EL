James Borrego going to Cuba 
The NBA is set to become the first U.S. professional sports league to visit Cuba since President Barack Obama ordered diplomatic relations between the countries to be restored.
The league will hold a four-day development camp and host clinics for youth from April 23-26. Recently retired two-time MVP Steve Nash, newly elected Hall of Famer Dikembe Mutombo, and former WNBA star Ticha Penicheiro will take part, along with NBA coaches Quin Snyder of Utah and James Borrego of Orlando.
Obama ordered relations with Cuba to be normalized in December. The NBA and FIBA, basketball's world governing body, also will invite two players and one coach from Cuba to participate in an upcoming Basketball without Borders camp for the first time.
Cuba has not performed well in international basketball. I see no short-term gain for the Magic here.
Cuba has been terrible in FIBA since the 1990's.
Maybe Borrego can bring back a case of cigars to distribute to the Magic players at the end of year meeting to contemplate
another dismal season.

That will make a fine going away gift from the former coach to his former players.
I hope. Oh, how I hope.
I'll take one of those '57 Chevys
