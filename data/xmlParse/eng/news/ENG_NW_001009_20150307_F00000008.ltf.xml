200	Who killed Russia opposition politician Boris Nemtsov?
278	Two arrests have been made over the murder of Russian opposition politician
354	Boris Nemtsov, a crime for which multiple theories still exist.
427	Was he killed in order to cow opposition to President Vladimir Putin at a time
506	of mounting economic problems? Or because he opposed Russia's alleged covert
583	war in Ukraine?
608	Or was he shot in full view of the Kremlin in an attempt to discredit Russia's
687	leaders or even intimidate them, or incite a rebellion against them? Perhaps
764	it was an opportunistic attack by someone harbouring a grudge?
836	Here are some of the theories circulating about who might be behind the
908	killing and why. Some of them stretch the imagination, possibly in an attempt
986	to obscure more obvious truths.
1027	The detainees
1050	Two men were arrested on 7 March, Russian security officials announced, on
1125	suspicion of organising and carrying out the murder.
1187	Little was revealed about Anzor Gubashev and Zaur Dadayev other than that they
1266	both from the Caucasus region.
1306	Unnamed security sources told Russian media they had been identified after
1381	their car was found and security camera images and phone bills were analysed.
1468	Nothing has been revealed officially about the two men's political allegiances
1547	and possible motive.
1577	Gunmen from the North Caucasus have been involved in occasional Islamist
1650	attacks and organised crime in Moscow since the 1990s, but latterly there is
1727	also evidence of them fighting on the pro-Russian rebel side in eastern
1799	Ukraine, where Russia is widely suspected of waging a covert war.
1874	Even if the two detainees are tried and convicted of the murder, many will
1949	want to know whose orders, if any, they were following.
2014	When five men were convicted last year of shooting journalist Anna
2081	Politkovskaya in 2006, a murder which equally shook Moscow, investigators
2155	failed to determine who ordered the killing.
2209	President Vladimir Putin
2243	The Russian leader sought to quell speculation over Kremlin involvement in the
2322	death of one of his opponents when he condemned Nemtsov's "brazen murder" and
2400	called for an end to the "shameful" political killings that have marked modern
2479	Russia.
2496	But Russia's best-known opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has accused the
2571	Kremlin over his friend's death.
2613	Denied the right to attend Nemtsov's funeral as he sat in custody doing a
2687	15-day sentence for illegal pamphleteering, he put out a statement (in
2758	Russian): "I believe that Nemtsov was murdered by members of a government
2832	(special services) or pro-government organisation on the order of the
2902	country's political leadership (including Vladimir Putin)."
2971	The question, he added, was whether the order had been given to kill Nemtsov
3048	or to "stage an action that would have a high impact".
3112	One of the puzzles of the Nemtsov assassination was that, as a liberal
3183	politician from the Yeltsin era, he did not enjoy the kind of popular support
3261	given to younger figures like Mr Navalny.
3312	But Mr Navalny argued in his statement that Russia's leaders had decided to
3388	combat the country's developing economic problems with a crackdown on the
3462	opposition. It was no longer enough for them to "fabricate criminal cases", he
3541	said, in a clear reference to the cases brought against him since the mass
3616	election protests of 2011-12.
3655	As for the perpetrators of the killing, he suggested they could have been
3729	members of informal militias allegedly used by the Kremlin as auxiliary
3801	police.
3818	One argument that might counter his theory of a new crackdown is that the
3892	security services already enjoy massive power under President Putin, whose own
3971	popularity rating increased last month to 86%, according to one poll.
4050	Rogue elements in Russian security services
4103	At the time of his death, Nemtsov was organising an anti-war rally in Moscow
4180	and there is some suggestion that the Kremlin or rogue elements in the
4251	security forces might have acted to stifle dissent about the war.
4326	"If you support stopping Russia's war with Ukraine, if you support stopping
4402	Putin's aggression, come to the Spring March in Maryino [a Moscow suburb] on 1
4481	March," Nemtsov wrote in a social media post, published hours before he was
4557	shot (in Russian).
4585	According to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Nemtsov was also planning
4662	to publish "some persuasive evidence about the involvement of Russian armed
4738	forces in Ukraine".
4767	Although the anti-war rally was cancelled, Russia's small independent media
4843	have pressed on with investigating allegations of covert warfare.
4918	It is impossible to know how real a threat Nemtsov posed to the authorities.
4995	And a ceasefire President Putin personally helped to negotiate for eastern
5070	Ukraine last month finally seems to be taking hold.
5131	Foreign intelligence services
5170	Mr Putin publicly condemned Nemtsov's murder, saying it was "entirely
5240	provocative in nature".
5273	"Provocation" is Kremlin code for an attack aimed at destabilising the Russian
5352	state. As to who might be behind such an attack, the Kremlin's "chief spin
5427	doctor", TV anchorman Dmitry Kiselev, made clear who he thought stood to
5500	benefit most.
5523	"When he was alive, Nemtsov was no longer necessary to the West, he had no
5598	prospects," he said. "But dead, he was a lot more interesting."
5671	It is a standard line on Russian state-run media that the CIA orchestrated the
5750	uprising in Ukraine last year and anti-Russian unrest in other ex-Soviet
5823	states in recent years.
5856	However, in the absence of any evidence, few people would take seriously the
5933	idea that the CIA staged the killing of Nemtsov in the hope of sparking a
6007	violent opposition reaction to President Putin's rule.
6071	An alternative Russian theory, set out in the pro-government Izvestia
6141	newspaper (in Russian) which quoted an unnamed police source, is that the
6215	Ukrainian secret service had Nemtsov assassinated by Chechen hit men in order
6293	to destabilise Russia.
6325	If this really was a genuine attempt to destabilise Russia, it may be too
6399	early to judge. So far opposition reaction has been largely muted, other than
6477	that of Mr Navalny in his jail cell.
6523	Ultra-nationalists or Islamic extremists
6573	Undoubtedly, there were Russians who hated Nemtsov for his liberal brand of
6649	politics and opposition to the war, seen as a sacred cause by many
6716	nationalists.
6739	"So who's Nemtsov?" asked one Moscow tweeter. "So much fuss while children and
6818	old people perish in Donetsk [eastern Ukraine] each day. Who remembers them?"
6905	One common extreme reaction circulating on Russian-language social media was,
6983	"A dog's death for a dog."
7019	One theory is that, rather than seeking mere revenge, Russian
7081	ultra-nationalists may have killed Nemtsov as a warning to Mr Putin not to
7156	back down in the conflict over Ukraine.
7205	"It is no secret that there are some very radical characters among both sides
7283	in the conflict [over Ukraine], who are not subordinated to any authorities,"
7361	said Vladimir Markin, spokesman for Russia's powerful Investigative Committee.
7449	Another theory advanced by the Investigative Committee (often accused of
7522	political bias itself) is that the killers might have been Islamist extremists
7601	enraged by his condemnation of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris.
7678	Nemtsov, a famously outspoken politician, made no secret of his Jewish
7749	extraction though he was a baptised Christian. But again, where is the
7820	credible claim of responsibility?
7863	Jealous lovers or crooks
7897	Nemtsov had been involved in a well-publicised anti-corruption campaign in
7972	Yaroslavl, a provincial town not far from Moscow.
8031	The one alternative theory for his murder given by Mr Navalny is that he had
8108	created deadly enemies in the region as a result.
8167	Contract murders for commercial reasons have become less common in Moscow
8241	under Vladimir Putin but do still occur. However, the killers were taking a
8317	massive risk attacking Nemtsov in one of the most heavily guarded areas of
8392	Moscow.
8409	What of the late politician's love life? Even admirers used the epithet
8481	"womaniser" in regard to him.
8520	However, the Ukrainian model less than half his age (he was 55) who was with
8597	him when he was shot on Friday night could say little about the attack.
8678	Anna Durytska, who was unhurt, told Russian media she had not seen the killer,
8757	who had struck from behind. All she had seen, she said, was a light-coloured
8834	car which quickly drove off, into the dark.
8887	What do we know about killing?
8927	Gunman fired into Nemtsov from behind with a pistol as he walked across a
9001	bridge below the Kremlin hand in hand with a young woman
9067	Killer then jumped over the barrier into the road and got into a waiting car,
9145	which looked like a Russian vehicle, a witness called Viktor told pro-Kremlin
9223	Russian news website LifeNews (in Russian)
9275	A police source told LifeNews the gunman was around 1.7m (five foot seven)
9350	tall with short dark hair, wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater
9425	Nemtsov's walking companion, Anna Durytska, saw a light-coloured car speeding
9503	off
9516	A police source told Russian daily Kommersant old bullets were used, possibly
9594	fired from a homemade gun. "Participants in the investigation are only sure of
9673	one thing - that the killers were not professionals," the source said
