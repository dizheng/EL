233	The horror I saw at Garissa University in AL SHABAB's hands - I saw Christians shot dead!
346	One of the survivors of the Garissa University College siege has spoken about
424	his experience through the events of the day when their university was under
501	siege from Al Shabaab insurgents in a terror attack that has now claimed 70
577	lives and injured more than 79.
618	Collins Wetangula, a second year student at the University, said when the
692	masked gunmen entered his hostel and he could hear them opening doors and
766	asking if the people who had hidden inside were Muslims or Christians.
846	"If you were a Christian you were shot on the spot. With each blast of the gun
925	I thought I was going to die," Wetangula told the Associated Press (AP).
1007	He said the terrorist struck at around 5 am and when he heard gunshots, him
1083	and three others locked themselves in their room.
1142	All I could hear were footsteps and gunshots nobody was screaming because they
1221	thought this will lead the gunmen to know where they are. The gunmen were
1295	saying, "Sisi ni Al-Shabab (Swahili for, 'We are Al-Shabab')," the students
1371	said.
1386	He said after two hours hiding in a dark room, Kenya's Special Forces entered
1464	through a window and took him and some other students to safety.
