316	After Bombing, Shooting, and Carjacking, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Didn’t Shoplift
414	Dzhokhar Tsarnaev faces 30 charges — 17 of which include the possibility of
490	the death penalty — for his role in the Boston Marathon bombings and
559	aftermath. But in a bizarre moment captured on video three days after the
633	bombing, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev decided not to chance a shoplifting charge.
713	Surveillance video of carjacking victim Dun Meng’s daring escape shows
784	Dzhokhar Tsarnaev actively deciding to turn around and return snacks that he
861	had not yet paid for.
892	Meng testified on Thursday that he was kidnapped and carjacked at gunpoint by
970	the brothers on the evening of April 18, 2013. With Tamerlan Tsarnaev
1040	distracted in the driver’s seat and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev gathering snacks
1111	inside a gas station, Meng scrambled to flee the vehicle and make it to
1183	safety.
1200	The older Tsarnaev then rushed into the store to get his brother and leave the
1279	scene before police arrived.
1317	As you can see in the GIF above, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev began to run out of the
1392	store with a handful of snacks. He then abruptly stopped, turned around, and
1469	quickly put the items down near the front counter. Finally, Tsarnaev placed
1545	his empty hands up and made eye contact with the shop owner as he bolted for
1622	the door.
1641	The surveillance video was taken on the evening of April 18, 2013. That’s
1715	three days after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother allegedly set off
1784	explosions that killed three people and injured over 260 others. And it’s
1858	about an hour after the brothers allegedly shot and killed MIT police officer
1936	Sean Collier in his vehicle.
