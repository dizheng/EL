241	New papers reveal lawsuit between Sara Netanyahu, brother
322	PM’s wife was sued for withdrawing NIS 60,000 from deceased father’s
391	account to pay for headstone, death announcements
450	Sara Netanyahu’s brother sued her in 2012 for withdrawing and using money
524	from her deceased father’s account without approval from other members of
598	her family, documents cleared for publication Thursday showed.
670	According to the report released by the family court of Jerusalem, after her
747	father, the Israeli poet and educator Shmuel Ben-Artzi, died in November 2011,
826	Netanyahu, wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, took out nearly NIS
900	60,000 from her father’s Bank Hapoalim account.
957	However, her brother, Hagai Ben-Artzi, disputed the use of the money.
1036	The report comes after weeks in which Sara Netanyahu has been pilloried in the
1115	press amid claims of excessive spending and an abuse lawsuit filed by a former
1194	caretaker of the Prime Minister’s Residence.
1248	According to court documents, Netanyahu took out the NIS 60,000 “despite the
1325	fact that at the time they had yet to receive a probate order and that
1396	Ben-Artzi had even told the bank of his objection to the payment.”
1472	The money was used to pay for a headstone and death announcements in Israeli
1549	newspapers, but Hagai Ben-Artzi, a Jewish philosophy professor, claimed that
1626	decision should have received his approval, as another recipient of the will.
1713	According to the bank, which appeared with Netanyahu in the suit, only one
1788	beneficiary is needed to withdraw funds from a deceased persons account.
1870	Sara Netanyahu and her brother ultimately decided on March 12, 2014 to settle
1948	the matter out of court.
