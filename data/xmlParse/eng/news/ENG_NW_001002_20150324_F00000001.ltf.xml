250	DHS Official Gave Special Favors To Hillary Clinton’s Brother
335	Alejandro Mayorkas, the former director of U.S. Customs and Immigration
407	Services, favored projects championed by Nevada U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, Virginia
486	Gov. Terry McAuliffe, and Hillary Clinton’s brother Tony Rodham, according
561	to an explosive new report from the Department of Homeland Security
629	inspector’s general (IG).
664	The IG concluded its investigation into whether Mayorkas, now the deputy
737	secretary at DHS, “exerted improper influence” in the adjudication of the
811	Employee-Based Fifth Preference (EB-5), which allows aliens to invest $500,000
890	in U.S. companies in order to gain residency for themselves and their
960	families.
979	And indeed, the IG determined that Mayorkas did improperly exert his
1048	influence, and on behalf of companies with ties to Reid, McAuliffe, and
1120	Rodham.
1137	“Mayorkas communicated with stakeholders on substantive issues, outside of
1212	the normal adjudicatory process, and intervened with the career USCIS staff in
1291	ways that benefited the stakeholders,” the report reads, noting that in each
1368	of those cases the outcome would have been different if not for Mayorkas’
1442	intervention.
1465	The report also noted that more than 15 USCIS employees at all levels conveyed
1544	“the same factual scenario: certain applicants and stakeholders received
1617	preferential access to DHS leadership and preferential treatment in either the
1696	handling of their application or petition or regarding the merits of the
1769	application or petition.”
1804	The IG, which began its investigations in Sept. 2012, also found that the
1878	number and variety of witnesses was “highly unusual” and characterized
1949	Mayorkas’ level of intervention as “unprecedented.”
2010	In one case, Mayorkas intervened on behalf of GreenTech Automotive, an
2081	electric car company controlled by Gulf Coast Funds Management. McAuliffe was
2159	chairman of Gulf Coast’s board while Tony Rodham was CEO.
2226	In an unrelated case, Rodham’s position with Gulf Coast earned him a spot on
2303	the board of a gold mining company with interests in Haiti. Rodham met the
2378	owner of that company, VCS Mining, at an event for the Clinton Global
2448	Initiative, his sister’s charity.
2491	The IG report shows that Mayorkas became involved in the Gulf Coast’s
2561	application in July 2010. He opposed USCIS employees’ decision to deny the
2636	company’s EB-5 visa applications, though staffers felt that the GreenTech
2710	project fell outside of the scope of the program and that it was “really not
2787	so good of a project.”
2819	But McAuliffe pushed for EB-5 and continuously called and met with Mayorkas on
2898	the matter. According to the IG report, after Gulf Coast’s application was
2973	initially denied, Mayorkas took a deep and special interest in the project,
3049	telling staff that he would personally oversee it. During one meeting, he
3123	shocked staffers by saying that he would take materials related to the
3194	application home so that he could work on the case.
3255	Many USCIS staff believed that Mayorkas’ interest in the project indicated
3330	that Gulf Coast was “wired in” to the agency.
3385	In early 2013, Mayorkas backed off of his hands-on involvement with the
3457	application. But it was understood within the agency that he still hoped to
3533	see its application approved. On Jan. 29, 2013, Rodham sent Mayorkas sent an
3610	email regarded processing delays. Mayorkas forwarded the email to staff with a
3689	“high importance” designation, according to the inspector general.
3765	Gulf Coast’s fourth amendment for application was approved in Feb. 2014.
3847	Mayorkas has previously denied exerting undue influence on behalf of Gulf
3921	Coast. Back in July 2013, after he was tapped by President Obama to take over
3999	as DHS deputy secretary, he responded to news that the IG was investigating
4075	his relationship with McAuliffe and Gulf Coast saying that it was
4141	“unequivocally false” that he had played favorites.
