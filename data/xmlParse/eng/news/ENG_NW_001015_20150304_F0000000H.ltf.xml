228	Tsarnaev attorney: 'It was him'
283	Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's attorney made one thing clear during her opening statement
362	in the Boston Marathon bombing trial: He did it.
420	"It was him," defense attorney Judy Clarke told jurors.
485	Tsarnaev carried one of the pressure cooker bombs on April 15, 2013, and
558	placed it near the finish line, she said. He was there when a police officer
635	was killed. He was involved in a shootout with police.
699	The accused bomber will not sidestep any of his actions, Clarke said.
778	So, why even a trial at all?
816	Because there's disagreement over why Tsarnaev did it, Clarke said.
893	Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was influenced by his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Clarke
968	said. He was enlisted by his brother to commit these horrific acts, she said.
1055	The first day of the trial provided jurors with a peek at the strategies of
1131	the prosecution and defense.
1169	Based on their opening statements, both sides agree on the basic facts around
1247	the attacks -- who carried them out and how. But both sides presented
1317	divergent views of why Dzhokhar Tsarnaev carried out the attacks.
1392	The goal of the Tsarnaev brothers was to kill as many people as possible, U.S.
1471	prosecutor Bill Weinreb said during his initial statement to jurors.
1549	The prosecutor described in detail the deaths of three victims near the finish
1628	line of the 2013 Boston Marathon and painted a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as
1707	a holy warrior committed to violence.
1754	More than 260 others were maimed or injured by two pressure cooker bombs that
1832	exploded within 12 seconds of each other.
1883	A fourth person, an MIT police officer, was ambushed and killed in his patrol
1961	car three days after the bombings as Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan,
2034	allegedly ran from police.
2070	Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed after a gunbattle with police.
2144	So it is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev who is on trial, charged with 30 counts related to
2222	the bombings.
2245	Weinreb said Tsarnaev's actions after the bombings -- going to Whole Foods to
2323	buy a gallon of milk, hanging out with friends -- show that he didn't care
2398	about what he did. To the contrary, the prosecutor told jurors, he believed he
2477	had done good.
2501	The motive for the attacks can be found in the boat that ultimately became
2576	Tsarnaev's hideout before his arrest, he said. There, Tsarnaev allegedly wrote
2655	messages explaining that he believed the U.S. government is an enemy of Islam.
2743	Tsarnaev listened to jihadist lectures and songs, and had an online presence
2820	in which he espoused a radical view of Islam, Weinreb said.
2889	He had a collection of magazines published by al Qaeda, one with instructions
2967	for building the same type of bomb used in the Boston Marathon attack, he
3041	said.
3056	The defense pinned the radicalization on Tamerlan.
3116	Clarke showed two side-by-side photos in court: One of the brothers smiling,
3193	and one of them carrying backpacks linked to the attacks.
3260	The attacks were "incomprehensible, they're inexcusable," she said, but also
3337	asked, who turned Tsarnaev from the smiling kid into a bomber?
3409	It was Tamerlan who self-radicalized, and Tamerlan who influenced his brother
3487	to follow him, she argued.
3523	Reliving the tragic moment
3559	At the outset of the trial, Weinreb spoke in detail to the jury about the
3633	lives ended by the pair of bombs at the marathon. Martin Richard, an
3702	8-year-old spectator, was standing with his family cheering runners on when
3778	the second bomb exploded just feet away.
3828	Martin was only 4 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 70 pounds, the prosecutor
3903	said. The bomb blew large holes into the boy's chest and organs -- "tore large
3982	chunks of flesh out of Martin's body," Weinreb said. The boy died.
4058	The first witness the prosecution called Wednesday was Thomas Grilk, executive
4137	director of the Boston Athletic Association.
4191	Grilk provided some facts about the marathon, but Assistant U.S. Attorney
4265	Aloke Chakravarty also asked him to talk about the day of the bombings.
4346	The prosecution played videos of the first explosion, then the second, showing
4425	people scrambling in the aftermath.
4470	Grilk let out a long sigh as one of the videos was paused.
4538	"Every day you walk outside, you are in that area," testified Shane O'Hara,
4614	the manager at Marathon Sports, a running store close to where the bombs went
4692	off.
4706	He was emotional as he vividly recounted what sounded to him like a loud
4779	cannon, and the instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows.
4853	O'Hara recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair,
4930	and cries for help.
4959	The decisions about who to aid first -- those among the injured needing help
5036	before others -- still haunt him, he said.
5088	There were cries, sirens and screams, he said in answer to prosecutors'
5160	questions.
5180	He sniffled as a photo of the blown-out storefront was shown in the court. He
5258	told the jury the plea he heard from one of the injured: "Stay with me, stay
5335	with me."
5354	Fearing death
5377	Wednesday's testimony centered on the stories of the survivors. Tsarnaev's
5452	lawyers opted not to cross-examine any of the witnesses who testified to what
5530	they lived through that day.
5568	Colton Kilgore and Rebekah Gregory were part of a large group who were present
5647	to cheer on a family member.
5685	Kilgore took the witness stand and described the videos he shot after the
5759	blasts. It was an instinct to record the scene, he said.
5825	"I was blown through the air. There was a deafening explosion," he said.
5907	He saw bodies and faces also tumble through the air. His videos captured the
5984	chaos, the cries for help, people using any material they could find to help
6061	perform first aid.
6089	At one point, Kilgore recalled, he sat on something hot, only to realize he
6165	was sitting on pieces of burning metal and shards.
6225	Gregory testified that she was watching the race, but also looking after her
6302	5-year-old, Noah, who was a bit bored.
6350	After the blast, she couldn't feel her legs.
6404	"My bones were literally laying next to me on the sidewalk," she said. "At
6479	that point I thought that was the day I would die."
6540	Her first instinct was for Noah's safety. She asked God to take her if she was
6619	indeed dying, but to let her know that Noah was OK.
6680	Somehow, she said, despite the confusion and her pain, she could hear his
6754	voice calling her.
6782	Noah was injured. Gregory now wears a prosthesis.
6841	Sydney Corcoran was a high school senior on the day of the bombings.
6919	Her testimony centered on her near certainty that she would die that day.
7002	She passed out and awoke to a group of men attending to her, putting pressure
7080	on her leg, trying to find where she was bleeding.
7140	One man put his forehead on her head and told her she would be OK.
7216	But then, another man said he could see her eyes were going white, she
7287	testified.
7307	"I could feel my body going tingly and I was getting increasingly cold. I knew
7386	I was dying," she told the jury.
7428	Jury cuts across class, but not race
7474	It took nearly two months of juror interviews -- 256 people over 22 court days
7553	-- to select the jury in the bombing trial.
7606	The group includes 18 people from across the socioeconomic spectrum, but the
7683	group is almost exclusively white.
7727	Race has been an issue raised by Tsarnaev's defense during four unsuccessful
7804	attempts to move the death penalty trial from Boston. His attorneys argued
7879	that the way the court issues jury summons led to picking a panel that's older
7958	and whiter than the community at large. But prosecutors argued that the jury
8035	had been picked properly.
8070	"The prosecution got exactly what they wanted," said CNN legal analyst Mark
8146	Geragos, a criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles.
8208	Middle-aged white jurors tend to be more likely to support death penalty
8281	verdicts, he said.
8309	"It's a target demographic for a death penalty jury."
8372	Just one juror seemed to combine youth and ethnic diversity. A college student
8451	who is taking a break from his studies, he said his mother was born in Iran
8527	and converted from Islam to the Baha'i faith.
8582	Will boat be brought to court?
8622	The Slip Away, a boat in which Tsarnaev sought cover after the police
8692	gunbattle, also is expected to be a key piece of evidence. The prosecution is
8770	seeking to remove a panel on which Tsarnaev allegedly scrawled incriminating
8847	messages so jurors can see it.
8887	Weinreb has said the boat is too large to bring into the courthouse.
8965	The defense, however, wants the jury to see the entire boat, complete with
9040	bullet holes. Defense attorney David Bruck argued that cutting out a panel
9115	would take the written words out of context and wouldn't fairly reflect
9187	Tsarnaev's state of mind.
9222	Court papers have already given the public a glimpse of several statements
9297	Tsarnaev allegedly wrote inside the boat:
9348	"The U.S. government is killing our innocent civilians," he allegedly wrote.
9425	"I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished."
9482	"We Muslims are one body. You hurt one, you hurt us all."
9549	"Now I don't like killing innocent people. It is forbidden in Islam but due to
9628	said (unintelligible) it is allowed."
9675	"Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop."
