241	Technical problems, Boko Haram mar general election
316	Problems with new technology on Saturday forced a 24-hour extension to the
391	presidential election in Africa’s most populous nation, Nigeria, and renewed
468	Boko Haram violence hit the knife-edge vote.
522	The Islamist militants were suspected of killing seven in separate attacks in
600	northeastern Gombe state, including at polling stations, while on Friday, 23
677	people were beheaded in Borno.
717	President Goodluck Jonathan was the most high-profile victim of the glitches
794	with handheld readers, which scan biometric identity cards to authenticate
869	voters to help cut electoral fraud.
914	The 57-year-old, who is seeking a second term of office, was forced to abandon
993	his attempt to accredit for the ballot in his home town of Otuoke, Bayelsa
1068	state, after the device repeatedly failed.
1120	He was then accredited by hand and later voted but said afterwards: “As head
1197	of state, I don’t blame anybody… I think the problem is national.”
1273	The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) accepted there had been
1350	“challenges” with the technology in “many” places that had forced
1416	polling officials to suspend the process.
1467	INEC information commissioner Chris Yimoga said he could not give a figure on
1545	how many people were affected, with voters also reporting the late and even
1621	non-arrival of election officials.
1665	“The problems are not in all the states of the country but in a few states
1740	and each of these (resident electoral commissioners) have been informed.”
1823	People in the affected areas will go back to the polls on Sunday, INEC said.
1909	“This is very sad indeed,” Peter Ogbuoni, a 31-year-old civil servant,
1980	said of Jonathan’s problems as he waited to vote in Otuoke in the
2046	oil-producing southern Delta.
2085	“If the president could spend more than 30 minutes without being accredited,
2162	I wonder how INEC will claim to have conducted a credible election?”
2240	– Polls attacked –
2268	The Boko Haram threat has dominated the election campaign, with the Islamist
2345	militant group’s leader Abubakar Shekau having threatened to disrupt the
2418	vote.
2433	A spate of suicide bombings and attacks on “soft” targets such as markets
2507	and bus station raised fears about the safety of voters and led to stringent
2584	security measures to be put in place countrywide.
2643	The rebels, who have recently been pushed out of captured territory in the
2718	restive northeast by a four-nation military coalition, appeared to hold good
2795	to that pledge by attacking Gombe state.
2845	At least seven people were killed when suspected Boko Haram gunmen launched
2921	separate attacks in the neighbouring villages of Birin Bolawa and Birin
2993	Fulani, the town of Dukku and nearby Tilen village.
3054	The first three attacks saw shots fired at voters at polling stations and
3128	election materials were burned.
3169	An election official, who requested anonymity, said: “We could hear the
3241	gunmen shouting, ‘Didn’t we warn you about staying away from (the)
3308	election?'”
3329	The beheadings happened in Buratai on the eve of voting, a nurse in Biu and
3405	lawmaker Mohammed Adamu, who represents the town some 200 kilometres (125
3479	miles) from the Borno state capital, Maiduguri.
3536	Voters turned out in force in Maiduguri, which has been repeatedly hit in the
3614	insurgency that has left more than 13,000 dead and some 1.5 million homeless.
3701	Civilian vigilantes swept voters, many of them women widowed by the violence
3778	or separated from their husbands, with hand-held metal detectors.
3853	“I am ready to cast my vote at whatever cost,” said Tandalami Balami, who
3927	fled the recently liberated town of Gwoza to a camp in Maiduguri.
4002	– Tight race –
4026	Jonathan, his main challenger Muhammadu Buhari and 12 other candidates are
4101	contesting the presidential poll, while 2,537 hopefuls from 28 parties are
4176	vying for 469 seats in parliament.
4220	The president’s ruling party has been in power since Nigeria returned to
4293	civilian rule in 1999 but the result is far from clear this time, with the
4368	opposition in its strongest position ever.
4420	The president’s inability to tackle Boko Haram — until recently — has
4490	dominated his tenure and while Nigeria became Africa’s largest economy on
4564	his watch, global oil shocks have hit the country hard.
4629	Even Jonathan has admitted that the election is close, with Buhari, a former
4706	military ruler, seen by some as an antidote to endemic government corruption
4783	and insecurity.
4808	The technical glitches could not have come at a worse time for Nigeria, after
4886	it delayed the scheduled February 14 vote by six weeks on security grounds and
4965	after a previous postponement in 2011.
5013	During the election campaign, Jonathan’s Peoples Democratic Party repeatedly
5090	criticised the use of the technology, which is designed to “read”
5156	fingerprints and other personal data in 10 seconds.
5217	It was backed by the main opposition All Progressives Congress (APC), whose
5293	candidate Buhari, was accredited without a hitch in his home town of Daura, in
5372	the northeast state of Katsina.
5413	Voting had begun in many places at 1230 GMT, including in Maiduguri and Yola,
5491	the capital of neighbouring Adamawa, where polling units had been set up for
5568	people made homeless by Boko Haram violence.
