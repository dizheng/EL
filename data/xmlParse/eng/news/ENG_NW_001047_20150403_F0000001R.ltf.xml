244	US and Iran hail deal on nuclear framework
310	The United States, Iran and five other world powers have announced an
380	agreement outlining limits on Iran’s nuclear programme to block it from
452	developing atomic weapons.
488	The move, after marathon negotiations, directs negotiators towards a final
563	accord this summer.
592	The US and Iran each hailed the framework, reached by weary but upbeat
663	diplomats after a week of intense diplomacy in Switzerland that capped 18
737	months of negotiations.
770	Speaking from the White House, US president Barack Obama called it a “good
845	deal” that would address concerns about Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
920	Crucially for the Iranians, it would also provide them broad relief over time
998	from international sanctions that have crippled their economy.
1070	Still, critics in both nations as well as wary US allies Israel and Saudi
1144	Arabia, were likely to oppose the “plan of action” because of concessions
1218	allowing Iran to maintain significant elements of a programme that could be
1294	used to produce energy or nuclear arms.
1343	“I am convinced that if this framework leads to a final comprehensive deal,
1419	it will make our country, our allies and our world safer,” Mr Obama
1487	declared. “It is a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives.”
