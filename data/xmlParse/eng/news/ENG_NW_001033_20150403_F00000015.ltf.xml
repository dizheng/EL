342	The European Union pledged Friday to support Kenya's fight against extremism
419	after 147 people were killed by Al-Shabaab gunmen in an attack on Garissa
493	University College.
522	"Violent extremism has once again targeted the right of the people of Kenya to
601	live in peace and freedom of religion," the bloc's foreign policy chief
673	Federica Mogherini said in a statement.

960	Mogherini, the former Italian foreign minister, restated the 28-nation EU's
1036	support for Kenya in "overcoming the threat from such terrorism", adding that
1114	it was "important that all play their part if we are to achieve that."
1194	"The EU's solidarity at this time is assured, and we will work on reinforcing
1272	our support for Kenya's counter-terrorism efforts," she said.
1343	Pope Francis has led worldwide condemnation of the day-long siege at the
1416	university, the country's deadliest attack since the 1998 bombing of the US
1492	embassy in Nairobi.
