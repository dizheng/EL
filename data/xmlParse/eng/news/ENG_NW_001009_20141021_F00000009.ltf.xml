196	The making and unmaking of Oscar Pistorius
262	He was one of the world's most successful sportsmen, an inspiration to
333	millions, but now Oscar Pistorius has been sentenced to five years in prison
410	for killing his girlfriend.
447	Breathless after the 75m swim, the boy climbs out of the pool with his stumps
525	trailing behind him, and into the arms of his friends.
589	He clambers on to the back of a classmate, Deon, who trots off with the
661	grinning 12-year-old Oscar as cargo.
707	The second part of the race is an 800m run, and the route stretches ahead of
784	them under a blue Johannesburg sky. As the five young racers pass the netball
862	courts, they leave behind the concrete path and feel the soft grass of the
937	school playing fields underfoot. Cheyne is in front, carrying Oscar's
1007	prosthetic legs under his arms.
1048	Oscar is carried over the finish line by Kaylem, who won the race but doubled
1126	back to pick up his friend. Like a human relay baton, Oscar completes the race
1205	after being passed from one friend to another, according to a pre-arranged
1280	plan.
1295	This vignette from early 1999 at Constantia Kloof Primary School in Roodeport,
1374	Johannesburg, sums up the childhood of Oscar Pistorius - never left out,
1447	surrounded by friends, often the centre of attention.
1510	But 15 years later, Pistorius is facing a prison sentence after shooting his
1587	girlfriend through a bathroom door. The attack happened just months after he
1664	was the poster boy at the London Paralympics and made history by competing in
1742	the Olympic Games three weeks earlier.
1790	Oscar Pistorius as a child
1826	The life of Pistorius can be seen in two arcs. There is one story of
1895	extraordinary determination - how this boy with no evident running talent at
1972	12 somehow scaled the heights of sport in just a few years. But the second
2047	story is how that innocent boy became, as weeks of testimony in court
2117	suggested, a man plagued by his temper, with a reckless love for guns and
2191	speed - condemned by the judge as "negligent" when he pulled the trigger.
2274	In one of Oscar's earliest memories, he hurtled down a hill near his home, in
2352	his brother Carl's go-kart, as the two of them began a lifelong passion for
2428	speed - they were "adrenalin junkies", Pistorius later wrote in his
2496	autobiography, Blade Runner.
2534	As the wall at the bottom of the hill loomed in front of them, with no brakes
2612	on the kart, Carl grabbed Oscar's prosthetic leg, yanked it off and pushed it
2690	into the wheel to bring the vehicle to a sudden stop.
2753	This narrow escape did nothing to dampen his new addiction - aged four he was
2831	riding mini-motorbikes. Soon after he was racing his father at go-karting.
2906	Aged 15, he was driving his brother's Golf, and as an adult a speedboating
2981	accident nearly ended his career.
3024	This hotheaded adventurousness in the young boy was partly encouraged by his
3101	family, who were determined that his disability would not make him a spectator
3180	in life. In the Pistorius family, who lived in a comfortable part of
3249	Johannesburg, no-one was allowed to say "I can't."
3309	Oscar and his mother
3339	Born with no fibulas - the smaller of the two lower leg bones - Oscar's legs
3416	were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old. Six months later, he
3494	received his first prosthetics, a defining moment in his life, he later said.
3572	This plaster and mesh fitted with a lycra "skin" was a liberation.
3639	Immediately, he says, he felt invincible and his energy was boundless.
3719	"I believe that it was at this time in my life that my personality was shaped,
3798	and that my family was instrumental in laying the foundation stones of my
3872	competitive nature, and of the man that I am today," he wrote in Blade Runner.
3960	His mother was a huge influence. She put inspirational notes into the
4030	lunchboxes of her children, and one letter she wrote for him he still keeps:
4107	"The real loser is never the person who crosses the finishing line last. The
4184	real loser is the person who sits on the side, the person who does not even
4260	try to compete."
4286	Getting ready for school, she would say: "Carl, put on your shoes. Oscar, put
4364	on your legs." He was different, but equal.
4417	In fact, the young Oscar didn't feel different at all.
4481	"He didn't like to be reminded that he was different because mentally he
4554	wasn't different," says Gianni Merlo, who co-authored Pistorius's book. "This
4632	was because of the way his mother brought him up as a kid. He has a spirit
4707	that is completely different because he was born that way. Without knowing
4782	what it feels like to be normal, you feel normal."
4842	As well as providing an emergency brake for go-karts, there were other
4913	advantages to prosthetic legs. Oscar never had to wear cricket pads and he
4988	could leave his leg dangling against a hot oven and not suffer terrible burns.
5067	Children at the beach marvelled at his small round footprints, while opponents
5146	on the rugby field who tackled him were left clutching an artificial limb.
5230	A major inspiration was a teacher at Constantia Kloof, Tessa Shellard, who
5305	encouraged him to take part in sports, even putting him in the school team for
5384	a prestigious nationwide triathlon series, despite him not being the best
5458	athlete.
5476	"I gave him the opportunity that maybe others didn't give him. I saw a
5547	youngster with a disability but one who had it within himself to persevere. He
5626	was like a little hero in my heart that, at that young age, he gave so much."
5713	He usually gave it everything, even though he often came last. That biathlon
5790	race, in which he was carried by his friends, came on a day when his
5859	prosthetics were hurting him and so they hatched a plan to spare him the pain.
5947	Oscar was bubbly and full of energy, says Shellard, and in 2007 he came back
6024	to the school and signed a photo of the two of them, writing: "Times of
6096	change, memories still the same, thank you for all the times you helped me
6171	up."
6185	Aged nine, he had his first fist-fight - over a girl - and more followed. The
6263	family's response? His father and grandfather taught him how to box. This was
6341	the time when he first learned to defend himself, he says, and he later proved
6420	on several occasions that he was never slow in lashing out, usually verbally,
6498	at people who annoyed him. The most public example was when, after defeat in
6575	the 200m at the London Paralympics, he accused Brazilian Alan Oliveira of
6649	using illegal blades - an incident captured on live TV.
6714	Despite this pluckiness, he showed little sporting talent in his early teens.
6792	That didn't shine until Pretoria Boys School, when he was able to use much
6867	lighter prosthetics, thanks to a family friend and design engineer, Chris
6941	Hatting.
6959	Initially it was endurance running, not sprinting, that interested him. He was
7038	showing ability in 10km races, and enjoying rugby and water polo. His
7108	discovery of sports in which he could properly compete, not just take part,
7184	meant his schooldays were generally happy - but three life-changing events
7259	cast a more sombre light on these years.
7309	The first was the divorce of his parents, which meant Oscar and his siblings
7386	were separated from their father and lived with their mother in a smaller
7460	house. Perhaps as a way to bridge this distance, his father bought Oscar and
7537	Carl a small speedboat and his sons found yet another means to race against
7613	each other - this time on water-skis.
7660	Then in March 2002 his mother Sheila died. To the 15-year-old it felt like his
7739	world's guiding light had been extinguished. He has the dates of her birth and
7818	death tattooed on his right arm.
7860	"Sport was my salvation, as it helped me get through this difficult time," he
7938	wrote. "My mother had been a strong woman, the centre of my world. Sporting
8014	activity was the only thing that could distract me from such a loss."
8093	His aunt Diana stepped in to play a greater part in the upbringing of Oscar,
8170	Carl and Aimee. She says Sheila was such a devoted mother that her death
8243	required a "huge adjustment at a difficult time developmentally" for the three
8322	teenagers.
8342	The death of Oscar's mother
8379	"Sheila valued each of her children for their individual talents and was proud
8458	of them," says Oscar's aunt, Diana Binge.
8509	"Strict, loving, spontaneous and always game for fun, she was also a devout
8585	Christian who brought her children up to observe the Christian way of life,
8661	something she tried to demonstrate in her own relationships.
8731	"She was open about Oscar's disability and shared her experience in bringing
8808	Oscar up in order to encourage other parents of disabled children. Oscar has
8885	continued her legacy of helping others.
8934	"Sheila had unique relationships with each of her children and losing her
9008	would have left a unique gap in each of their lives, which each of them had to
9087	handle in their own way."
9122	A year after his mother's death came the third life-changing event - he
9194	shattered his knee on the rugby pitch.
9242	It came at a time when he had been working hard on his general fitness, to
9317	complement his rugby and water polo. One trainer, Jannie Brooks, has spoken
9393	about how Pistorius used his gym in Pretoria for six months - boxing, skipping
9472	and doing press-ups - before he realised he had no legs. "He was just one of
9549	the bunch, doing everything at the same pace as everybody else."
9623	But after the injury, he was back with the same medics who had carried out the
9702	amputations when he was a baby, and his recovery was slow. It was during his
9779	rehabilitation, supervised by the University of Pretoria, that he was advised
9857	to take up sprinting to help the knee joint recover. At the same time, Hatting
9936	- now working for a firm in the US - was working on new, lighter prosthetics
10013	and he invited Oscar to fly to the US to try the Flex-Foot Cheetah blades,
10088	manufactured by Ossur.
10120	Three weeks after taking up sprinting, Pistorius ran his first 100m race. With
10199	his father watching in Bloemfontein, he won the race in a time faster than any
10278	double amputee had achieved before - 11.72s. A star was born.
10349	Eight months later, he won the 200m gold at the Paralympics in Athens and his
10427	life changed forever. It was at this moment - September 2004 - that the world
10505	woke up to his talent and personality.
10553	Before long he began running against non-disabled athletes, first in a Golden
10631	Gala 400m race in Rome in 2007, finishing second, and then in Sheffield where,
10710	in very wet conditions, he finished last.
10761	The question now began to be asked whether his prosthetics gave him an
10832	advantage.
10852	It was a huge blow when, the following year, the world governing body for
10926	athletics (IAAF) concluded that they did, and banned them. But he fought the
11003	decision and won an appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in
11077	Lausanne, paving the way for him to compete in the summer Olympic Games in
11152	Beijing later that year. Failing to qualify, he set his sights on London in
11228	2012, where in due course he became the first track and field athlete to
11301	compete in both Paralympic and Olympic Games.
11356	"Oscar, with his personality, athletic prowess and the fact that he was trying
11435	to compete in the able-bodied Olympics made him the big breakthrough name, who
11514	brought sponsorship in Paralympic sport to the next level, internationally,"
11591	says Paralympic commentator Tony Garrett, who has known Pistorius since he
11666	burst on to the scene in Athens.
11708	Not only was he a very good athlete, says Garrett, one who broke down the
11782	barriers between disabled and non-disabled sport, he was a good-looking young
11860	man full of vitality, ready to take on the world.
11919	Pistorius has always strongly rejected the suggestion that his fight to
11991	compete in the Olympics meant he regarded Paralympic sport as second-rate. He
12069	says he just believed it was unfair to exclude disabled athletes from taking
12146	part, if they were good enough. "I am not a Paralympic athlete, nor an Olympic
12225	athlete. I am simply an athlete and sprinter."
12281	Despite his relatively privileged background, his achievements made him a hero
12360	to many south Africans, even if they came from different communities. He was a
12439	unifying figure. "For us South Africans," wrote Justice Malala in the
12509	Guardian, "it is impossible to watch Oscar Pistorius run without... wanting to
12588	break down and cry and shout with joy."
12637	But as the sponsorship deals and media appearances multiplied, Garrett was not
12716	the only person to notice a change in the man he knew.
12780	In 2011, Pistorius had stormed out of a BBC radio interview after taking
12853	exception to a question about his fight to take part in non-disabled
12922	athletics. Then there was the outburst at the London Games, when he lashed out
13001	at Alan Oliveira. Another South African Paralympian, Arnu Fourie, told a
13074	journalist he had to change rooms in the athletes' village because Pistorius
13151	was shouting on the phone so much.
13195	"His lifestyle and image changed and clearly something got to him and he
13268	wasn't the same person, there were so many demands on his time," says Garrett.
13347	"I think he let rip every so often and he wouldn't have done that a few years
13425	ago."
13440	Other acquaintances concur that his character subtly altered. Sports
13509	journalist Graeme Joffe, who co-owned a racehorse called Tiger Canyon with
13584	Pistorius and three others, first met him 13 years ago. Then Pistorius was an
13662	athlete of enormous promise and Joffe was really impressed by his confidence
13739	and charisma.
13762	"But three years ago, the syndicate was put together and I and some of the
13837	other owners met him at the stables. I immediately thought there was something
13916	about Oscar that had changed," he says. "He was a different man to the one I
13993	had interviewed so many times, in the sense that he was a bit stand-offish and
14072	a little bit cold, not his usual warm self."
14126	Joffe says he had taken note of Pistorius's behaviour towards the BBC
14196	interviewer, and was aware of an earlier incident when Pistorius, captaining a
14275	speedboat, was involved in an accident in which someone could have been
14347	killed.
14364	"These were big red flags for me and I was quite surprised that no-one in the
14442	media or in his management team condemned it publicly," says Joffe. "He was
14518	showing a spoilt-brat attitude that came out a year later at the Paralympics
14595	[in 2012] when he embarrassed the country."
14648	This wasn't just about fame going to his head, says Joffe, there were other
14724	incidents over the years that suggested an aggressive side and a recklessness
14802	that the public didn't see - at least not until the trial.
14870	There was a gun that went off in a restaurant and another shot through a car
14947	roof, and the odd verbal and physical fight. The South African media didn't
15023	explore this unpalatable side of the national hero, says Joffe. And
15091	journalists who questioned whether Pistorius's blades could give him an
15163	advantage were given no more interviews.
15213	What did make headlines - at least, in the celebrity press - was the romance
15290	with Reeva Steenkamp. The two met in November 2012 through a mutual friend at
15368	a motoring event and she agreed to accompany him to an awards ceremony that
15444	night as he didn't have a date.
15485	The model was already a reality show star and a regular presence on the cover
15563	of magazines. She was also hugely popular. Her best friend and housemate Gina
15641	Myers told the BBC this was a woman "as magnificent on the inside as she was
15718	beautiful on the outside".
15754	A friend of the couple, Del Levin, saw the couple at a dinner about two weeks
15832	before Steenkamp's death, when Levin's wife, a well known television
15901	personality, sat next to her and the two women spoke for a long time. Levin
15977	and his wife got the impression the couple, who had then known each other for
16055	about three months, were happy.
16096	By his own admission, Pistorius's relationships with women over the years have
16175	been turbulent. In his book, he referred to a "particularly nasty argument"
16251	here, a "very fiery" relationship there.
16301	"He could get very furious suddenly," says his biographer Merlo. "He spoke of
16379	a fire inside. He had tough arguments with girls and afterwards sweet
16449	reconciliation. He has always had very beautiful girlfriends. I never saw the
16527	temper but sometimes there were situations where it was [apparent]. Sometimes
16605	he can explode but I have always seen the bright part of the moon, I've never
16683	seen the dark part."
16713	Before Pistorius became a celebrity, he was very open to people, very
16783	friendly, says Merlo, who first met the athlete in 2007 in Rome and began
16857	working on the book with him the following year.
16915	People fell in love with him when they met him, he says, but the red carpet
16991	wasn't a stage upon which he felt comfortable. "It's not easy for a young guy
17069	who becomes a celebrity to follow the light that you see from afar that can be
17148	your light."
17170	Merlo agrees with those who say Pistorius underwent a change. But some friends
17249	of the athlete tell a very different story - of a man full of warmth and fun
17326	who overcame life's setbacks and stayed loyal despite his fame.
17399	Levin, a marketing director, says that unlike many in Johannesburg's high
17473	society, the athlete was sincere in his affections.
17534	"I wasn't a close friend but I got to know him over the years. He was an
17607	amazing, generous and courteous and kind person, easy to get along with, and
17684	very willing to share his own experiences and insights.
17749	"Typically when you meet someone on the social scene, they're very cold and
17825	stand-offish and particularly if you are the spouse of someone [famous] but he
17904	was someone who embraced me from the beginning. He would see me and run over
17981	and say 'Hey' and talk, and we would catch up and see how things were. He was
18059	definitely not just faking it but genuinely interested in you."
18132	One thing that did strike Levin was Pistorius's fears about security. He had
18209	recently bought a new home in the Johannesburg suburb of Sandton and talked
18285	about how happy he was that it was equipped with more safety features than his
18364	house in Pretoria.
18392	Little did he know that his home would become the subject of such scrutiny in
18470	the months ahead. Few bedrooms, bathrooms, doors, duvets, fans and electric
18546	sockets have been pored over in such detail.
18600	And instead of enjoying his dream house, his new home will be a prison cell.
18677	The freedom and companionship of the sunny playing fields of Constantia Kloof
18755	Primary School must seem a world away.
