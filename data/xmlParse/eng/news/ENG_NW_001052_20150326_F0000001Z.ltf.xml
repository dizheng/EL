250	Monica Lewinsky’s story needs to begin a new chapter: Timson
334	I still don’t know what to make of Monica Lewinsky.
395	The former White House intern whose name, at 24, became worldwide shorthand
471	for, as she said recently, “tramp, tart, slut, whore, bimbo and of course
545	That Woman” after her sexual relationship with then President Bill Clinton
620	resulted in his impeachment (spoiler alert, he survived nicely) is now 41,
695	back in the spotlight, and saying some wise things.
756	“Insist on a different ending to your story,” Lewinsky said last week in a
831	universally acclaimed TED Talk condemning “public shaming as a blood
900	sport.”
917	Describing herself as “patient zero” in internet shaming — there was no
989	social media in 1998, but news of her affair with Clinton as a young woman
1064	first broke on the gossipy online Drudge Report — Lewinsky called for a
1136	revolution in “compassion and empathy”.
1185	She described how humiliated she had been when salacious details became
1257	public: “I lost my reputation, my dignity, I almost lost my life.”
1333	Those details included snapping her thong at the pathetically weak-willed
1407	president to get his attention, administering oral sex to him beneath his desk
1486	as he talked to congressional leaders, and that infamous blue dress stained
1562	with his bodily fluids that made its way into rap songs
1627	She was fat shamed — one paper called her “the portly pepper pot” —
1695	slut shamed, and portrayed as an opportunistic sexual predator — albeit one
1771	who snagged the biggest predator of all.
1821	Lewinsky’s TED Talk was beautifully rendered, as was her earlier essay in
1895	Vanity Fair magazine in which she had a sharp message for feminist thought
1970	leaders who were so desperate to keep a Democratic president in office they
2046	formed a mean girls club of their own, cackling about everything from her
2120	“third stage gum disease” to whether other men would go after what Bill
2192	Clinton had enjoyed: “I sorely wished for some sign of understanding from
2266	the feminist camp ... Given the issues at play — gender politics, sex in the
2343	workplace — you’d think they would have spoken up.”
2404	Lewinsky did lose much of her life. With a graduate degree from the London
2479	School of Economics, she seems not to have achieved any of the personal or
2554	professional milestones a smart, personable woman of her age normally would
2630	have—no career, no permanent relationship, no family of her own.
2704	She puts it down to the outpouring of ridicule and opprobrium that first
2777	paralyzed her, and then to the ongoing prurience that never let people see her
2856	as a real human being.
2888	Yet 17 years is a long time to wander in the wilderness of shame. I know women
2967	who have recovered from deep personal trauma and gone on to have productive
3043	lives. Why not Monica Lewinsky?
3084	Thankfully, she does not paint herself totally as a victim—she laments her
3159	“poor choices”.
3184	But she is disingenuous in saying her big mistake was “I fell in love with
3259	my boss.” That makes her sound like everywoman in an office, instead of what
3336	she was—attention seeking, foolhardy, and very proactive in pursuing what
3410	she calls “a consensual” relationship with a powerful man whose roving eye
3485	was well known.
3510	I’ve never understood why she kept that incriminating blue dress, stained
3584	with the semen of the most powerful man in the world. She testified that her
3661	“frenemy,” government employee Linda Tripp, who ultimately outed her,
3731	“told me that I should put it in a safe-deposit box because it could be
3803	evidence one day. And I said that was ludicrous because I would never — I
3877	would never disclose that I had a relationship with the president.”
3954	She was forced to do just that under oath by very scary men, including odious
4032	prosecutor Ken Starr, who admitted he “loved the narrative” of shame he
4104	had uncovered. The result was a moral and political cataclysm in America.
4187	And now, just as Hillary Clinton, who in wifely frustration once called her a
4265	“narcissistic loony tune,” is embarking on her presidential bid, Lewinsky
4339	is back, declaring she has been “stuck” for too long, and it’s time to
4410	“bury the blue dress and move forward.”
4459	Timing is everything. Would people have paid this much attention if the
4531	Clintons were not still dominating the news cycle?
4591	Here’s a startling thought. Monica Lewinsky may ultimately be credited as
4665	the catalyst for the first female American president.
4728	In Carl Bernstein’s excellent 2007 Hillary Clinton biography, A Woman in
4801	Charge, he argues it was shortly after the devastating Lewinsky scandal, that
4879	Clinton made up her mind to separate herself from her husband’s agenda and
4954	run for the Senate. Without her successful tenure as a senator, Clinton could
5032	not run for president.
5064	Hah. F. Scott Fitzgerald got it seriously wrong when he argued there were
5138	“no second acts” in American life. The Clintons and now Monica Lewinsky
5210	are having spectacular second acts.
5255	But I hope for her sake that Lewinsky, after contributing profoundly to an
5330	urgent conversation about how badly we treat each other online, can stop using
5409	her beleaguered past and get on with living a life complete with meaningful
5485	work and relationships.
5518	Lewinsky can’t change or deny the past but the really triumphant ending she
5594	should insist on would be in not letting it—in bad or even good
5658	ways—define her one second longer.
