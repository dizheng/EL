233	How the Wives of ISIS Are Attracting Western Women to Syria
316	Women are joining ISIS at an ever-growing rate. Could online recruitment by
392	current jihadi wives be a factor?
435	“You can find shampoos soaps and other female necessities here, so do not
509	stress if you think you will be experiencing some cavewomen life here. …And
585	lastly for the married sisters or soon to be married, bring makeup and
656	jewellery from the West because trust me there is absolutely nothing here.
731	…Unless you plan on looking like a clown ting.”
788	These are the words Umm Layth published on her Tumblr, “Diary of a
855	Muhajirah,” meaning one who has made the “hijrah,” or journey to the
924	Islamic State. Umm Layth is a blogger from the north of Britain who is now
999	living in the Syrian town of Manbij. She is one of a growing number of Western
1078	women who have gone to Syria to pledge their lives to ISIS—and the men of
1152	ISIS. Manbij, her new home, is a small town in the Aleppo governate, where
1227	images show squat concrete buildings adorned with the extremist group’s
1299	black-and-white logo. ISIS has controlled the town since January 2014.
1379	Sometimes Umm Layth’s posts are more philosophical:
1440	“We are created to be mothers and wives—as much as the western society has
1515	warped your views on this with a hidden feminist mentality.”
1585	Another woman, who goes by the name of Umm Muawiyah, arrived in the area
1658	controlled by ISIS on Oct. 8, tweeting:
1707	“Alhamdulillah [thank God]. I have made it to Dar al-Islam and am finally
1781	living under the shade of the Sharia. Join me my brothers and sisters.”
1862	Prior to the first photo from her travels into Syria, her Twitter timeline was
1941	a mixture of discussion about ISIS and jokes about having to study “the
2013	stages of a break up” for her A-levels, exams British students typically
2086	take when they reach 18 years old. On Sept. 21, she tweeted:
2156	“Psychology a2 is so buff, guys.”
2199	ISIS has proved to be adept at using social media, and the group’s female
2273	followers, particularly those from England, are no exception. Glancing at
2347	assorted tweets, Tumblrs, Instagram, Ask.fm pages and Facebook accounts of
2422	ISIS supporters, it’s initially tricky to distinguish between the online
2495	white noise of 15-year-olds in Wigan, an English town, who want to seem edgy
2572	by supporting the group, and genuine followers on the ground.
2643	A closer look, however, shows a cadre of real ISIS followers who have made the
2722	hijrah and are leaving an online account of the day-to-day workings of life
2798	under ISIS. By adopting a more everyday, accessible approach to their posts,
2875	the women have carved out a social media niche, composing listicles like “10
2952	Marriage Facts From the Islamic State,” which was published by a blogger who
3029	goes by “Bird of Jannah,” referring to the Islamic name for heaven. The
3101	list includes details such as how the Euphrates is every newlywed’s favorite
3178	date spot, and how married mujahideen are given seven days off, and a gift of
3256	$700 by ISIS.
3279	The women broadcast their realities through social media much like anyone of
3356	their generation, using the platforms to make sense of their lives by sharing
3434	personal details and reflections in public. Their ability to be relatable has
3512	made these women a crucial part of the ISIS media machine. And just like their
3591	male counterparts, the women are fighting a running battle with the Twitter
3667	police, who frequently suspend their accounts.
