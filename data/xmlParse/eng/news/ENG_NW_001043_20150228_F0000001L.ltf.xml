240	Death threats and a late night dinner before Russia's Nemtsov was shot dead
339	It was near closing time on Friday at the upscale Bosco restaurant that looks
417	out onto the illuminated red-brick walls of Moscow's Kremlin. Boris Nemtsov
493	and his young, dark-haired girlfriend were finishing dinner.
563	A political reformer who had fallen foul of Russian President Vladimir Putin,
641	Nemtsov had been preoccupied for weeks with details of an opposition march
716	planned for Sunday.
745	Dinner at Bosco - dishes include beef with rocket salad and balsamic sauce or
823	duck liver with wild berries - had been interrupted by telephone calls, a
897	waiter told a Russian newspaper. Nemtsov also broke off for an interview with
975	a Ukrainian radio station eager for the details of the rally.
1046	Hopes were high that the demonstration, to condemn Putin's economic and
1118	foreign policies, would rekindle the flames of the street protests that in
1193	2011-12 posed the first public challenge to Putin's more than decade-long
1267	rule.
1282	The pair were among the last to pay their bill in the restaurant with its high
1361	airy ceilings and large windows. At around 11 p.m. Nemtsov, 55, a tall
1432	athletic figure with a mop of curly brown greying hair, escorted his
1501	girlfriend of some three years, Anna Duritskaya, more than 30 years younger,
1578	out onto Red Square.
1608	Opposite them, across the cobbles stood the marble tomb that still bears the
1685	body of Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, whose communist economic order
1757	Nemtsov helped dismantle after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
1836	Nemtsov's apartment was a half hour walk away at a leisurely pace. The couple
1914	turned left, passing to their right the candy-coloured onion domes of St
1987	Basil's Cathedral. Beyond that, soared the Kremlin's Spassky Gate topped with
2065	glowing crimson five-pointed star, another reminder of the Soviet past.
2146	Further down the slope, they walked onto the Great Moskvoretsky Bridge; but
2222	Nemtsov never made it across.
2261	Less than three hours later, policemen were washing his blood from the masonry
2340	and onto the banks of the Moscow River. He had been shot four times in the
2415	back and head in one of the worst shootings Moscow has seen in years.
2494	Nemtsov had enemies politically and personally. Even among the opposition, his
2573	outsized character pulled some into his orbit and pushed others away, at times
2652	polarising the fractious team of oppositionists.
2710	But for Nemtsov, the biggest opponent sat in the Kremlin.
2777	Only hours earlier, Nemtsov had given one of his last interviews, criticising
2855	Putin, comparing his rule to the Nazi Third Reich and promising an uprising
2931	from the streets.
2958	"We need to work as quickly as possible to show the Russians that there is an
3036	alternative, that Putin's policy leads to degradation and a suicide of the
3111	state. There is less and less time to wake up," Nemtsov told a correspondent
3188	for the Polish edition of Newsweek.
3233	"PUTIN AND WAR"
3258	There was a time when Nemtsov's own sights were set on the country's top seat
3336	of power. Amidst the chaos of the 1990s, president Boris Yeltsin had marked
3412	out Nemtsov, then a young, reform-minded deputy prime minister who had made
3488	fast friends with the country's richest and most powerful oligarchs.
3566	Yeltsin had considered handing him the reins of power, but ultimately ceded
3642	the presidency to a little known ex-KGB officer: Vladimir Putin.
3716	Photographs from Nemtsov's political career as a deputy prime minister and
3791	opposition lawmaker show very formal interactions with Putin, the two shaking
3869	hands at a distance with fixed smiles.
3917	But in recent years Nemtsov had become a greater thorn in Putin's side,
3989	compiling reports on sensitive topics - one that tried to expose the scale of
4067	corruption at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.
4122	Nemtsov's friends said his latest effort was to expose the presence of Russian
4201	troops in eastern Ukraine, where NATO, Kiev and Western governments say Russia
4280	has sent soldiers and weapons to support an armed uprising there.
4355	Moscow has denied the accusations repeatedly.
4410	"Boris Nemtsov received threats in the past, mostly anonymous ones. That was
4487	the nature of things," said Nemtsov's fellow opposition leader Ilya Yashin.
4572	While Nemtsov received threats, law enforcement sources said he never went to
4650	the police to ask for protection. But as time passed, his worries grew. In an
4728	interview on Feb. 10 with lesser known Internet outlet Sobesednik, Nemtsov
4803	said that his mother had started to worry that Putin could have Nemtsov killed
4882	for his opposition politics.
4920	The journalist asks: "After such conversations with your mother did you begin
4998	to worry that Putin could kill you either personally or through an
5065	intermediary?"
5089	Nemtsov: "You know, yeah... a little. Not so much as mama, but still."
5169	SURVEILLANCE
5191	Investigators say the killers drove past Nemtsov and Duritskaya in a white
5266	Ford as they turned from Red Square onto the bridge, firing six bullets from a
5345	Makarov pistol, the kind used for years by Soviet and Russian police officers.
5433	Four of the bullets hit their mark in Nemtsov's back and head, killing him
5508	immediately.
5530	In the minutes leading up to the shooting, a law enforcement source told
5603	Russian news agency Interfax that a spotter for the attackers watched the pair
5682	turn onto the bridge before giving the signal to attack - proof that the
5755	killing had been planned.
5790	Opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose star had eclipsed Nemtsov's in the
5865	years that followed the 2011-12 street protests, met with Nemtsov on an
5937	infrequent basis, and usually just to discuss logistics of protests, as they
6014	did several weeks previously.
6053	Navalny wrote on his Facebook page on Saturday he knew people were following
6130	the leaders of the demonstration, which planned to protest against the
6201	political and economic policies the opposition says are leading Russia to
6275	ruin.
6290	Weeks previously he had met in private with Nemtsov only to have the former
6366	governor later recount to him in a phone call how he was later called by a
6441	pro-Kremlin reporter to ask about the details of the secret meeting.
6519	"We all saw many times the publication of (video and voice recordings) of
6593	Nemtsov," wrote Navalny.
6627	"I practically exclude that surveillance was not being carried out on Boris
6703	Nemtsov last night," he wrote.
6743	It was a ten minute car drive to Bosco from the radio station facilities of
6819	Echo Moskvy, one of Moscow's last independent minded media outlets, where
6893	Nemtsov did an on air radio interview right before dinner.
6961	Following news of Nemtsov's death, Echo Moskvy editor in chief Alexei
7031	Venediktov tweeted a photo of himself and Nemtsov.
7091	"Today ahead of broadcasting, Boris asked me 'aren't you afraid of having me
7168	on air?' It wasn't me who should have been afraid."
