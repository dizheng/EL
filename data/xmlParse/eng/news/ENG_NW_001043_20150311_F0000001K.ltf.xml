243	Suspects in Nemtsov killing probably tortured - Russian rights activist
338	Three suspects in the killing of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov have
416	probably been tortured while in detention, a member of the Kremlin's advisory
494	council on human rights said on Wednesday.
546	After visiting three of the five ethnic Chechen suspects at Moscow's Lefortovo
625	prison as part of a monitoring group, rights activist Andrey Babushkin said
701	the men detained over the Feb. 27 murder had suffered multiple injuries.
783	Nemtsov was the most prominent of a string of Kremlin critics to be killed
858	during President Vladimir Putin's 15-year rule. The brazen shooting in the
933	heart of Moscow has shocked his colleagues and supporters, who say the
1004	investigation is a test of the rule of law in Russia.
1067	A Russian judge has said former Chechen policeman Zaur Dadayev, who is being
1144	held along with his cousins, Anzor and Shagid Gubashev, has admitted
1213	involvement in the murder. Dadayev and Anzor Gubashev have been formally
1286	charged.
1304	"There are reasonable grounds to believe that Dadayev and the Gubashevs were
1381	tortured," Babushkin wrote on his website.
1433	He said Dadayev had "multiple injuries" visible on his body, while Anzor
1506	Gubashev had abrasions around his nose, wrists and legs that were incurred
1581	after he was detained.
1613	In a conversation with Babushkin, Dadayev said he had only admitted his guilt
1691	after being promised that the authorities would then free his friend Rustam
1767	Yusupov, who was detained at the same time.
1820	"They said if I confess, they would let him out. I agreed. I thought that I
1896	would save him and they would take me to Moscow alive," he said according to a
1975	transcript published in Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper, whose reporter was
2051	present during the visit.
2086	Babushkin said Yusupov had since disappeared.
2141	When Anzor Gubashev was asked where he had received bruises and wounds on his
2219	wrists and legs, he said he was beaten, according to the newspaper's
2288	transcript.
2309	"Were the beatings recorded when you arrived in prison?"
2375	"Yes," Gubashev responded.
2411	His brother Shagid said that he had been beaten by two law enforcement
2482	officers who called one another Mikhailovich and Petrovich.
2551	Russia's Investigative Committee, in charge of the Nemtsov case, said that
2626	questions posed by Babushkin and the journalist were an attempt to obstruct
2702	its work. It said both would be called in for questioning over their actions.
2789	Babushkin called on the Kremlin's human rights council to inform Putin of his
2867	findings and said law enforcement agencies should investigate the torture
2941	allegations.
2963	Aides to Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, suspect Russia's state
3036	security apparatus is complicit in the killing. They are scornful of the
3109	investigation and say blaming Chechen Islamists is aimed at deflecting
3180	suspicion from Putin, his inner circle or the security services.
3254	Putin has condemned the shooting and promised to bring the perpetrators to
3329	justice.
3347	The head of the watchdog group with which Babushkin made his visit to
3417	Lefortovo prison said he was unable to confirm the allegations of torture
3491	after speaking to the prisoners and reviewing their medical records, Interfax
3569	news agency reported.
3600	Moskovsky Komsomolets also published pictures of the white getaway car
3671	allegedly used by the suspects after Nemtsov was shot four times in the back.
3758	Russian investigators said last week they were looking into the possibility
3834	that Islamists had shot Nemtsov for defending cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad
3913	in French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo after Islamist gunmen killed 12
3988	people in an attack on its offices on Jan. 7.
4043	But the newspaper said the car had been seen outside Nemtsov's house as early
4121	as last year, which would undermine the theory of a link to the Charlie Hebdo
4199	attack.
