240	American Sniper' Widow on Oscars: "It's Bittersweet"
316	It was hard for Taya Kyle not to cry on her way to Hollywood's biggest night.
403	The wife of the late Chris Kyle, the U.S. Navy SEAL who was the inspiration
479	for American Sniper, told People magazine that memories of her husband weighed
558	heavy on her mind. She is currently in the middle of a murder trial for former
637	marine Eddie Ray Routh, who admitted to shooting Kyle at a Texas gun range in
715	2013.
730	"I'm just hoping I make it through without sobbing my eyes out," she said. "On
809	the drive over here I was just fighting the tears so much.... Of course it's
886	bittersweet."
909	Kyle acknowledged she was grateful for the success of American Sniper and
983	celebrated on the carpet with Clint Eastwood, Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller
1062	during the glitzy affair.
1097	"Warner Bros. has really kind of treated me to a once-in-a-lifetime
1165	experience," she said. "They got the dress, the jewelry, the makeup, the hair.
1244	There's no way I could have been here without their help or looked somewhat
1320	presentable without their help."
1362	Sniper was the highest-grossing Oscar-nominated film, but it only took home
1438	the Oscar for best sound editing out of its six nominations.
1508	"I'm really grateful to them for first of all making an amazing movie that
1583	military families can relate to," said Kyle. "On a personal level, there's no
1661	way I could have been here without their help."
