234	HINDOCHA AND STEENKAMP FAMILIES UNITE
295	The parents of slain model Reeva Steenkamp and honeymoon bride Anni Dewani
370	were uniting in their grief, the Saturday Star reported.
436	"I'm delighted that Reeva's parents have said they will support us and am very
515	grateful for that," Anni's father, Vinod Hindocha, told the newspaper.
595	"Mr Steenkamp and I talked about Reeva and Anni and I gave him my sympathy
670	too. Only he and I as fathers can properly understand the pain of losing a
745	daughter to bullets and then experience very difficult and high-profile
817	cases."
834	The Steenkamps and Hindochas were supporting each other in calling for justice
913	in both cases.
937	The Steenkamps have backed calls by the Hindocha family for Anni's husband,
1013	Shrien Dewani, to give evidence about her murder.
1072	Shrien Dewani was allegedly the mastermind behind a staged hijacking that led
1150	to his bride's death in Cape Town in 2010.
1202	Anni was killed by a single bullet to the neck. Steenkamp was shot dead by her
1281	boyfriend, paralympian Oscar Pistorius on Valentine's Day last year. He
1353	claimed to have mistaken her for an intruder.
1408	The Western Cape High Court would on Monday rule on whether the case against
1485	Dewani should be dismissed.
1522	Meanwhile, the High Court in Pretoria would on Tuesday hear the request to
1597	appeal Pistorius's conviction and sentence.
1650	He is serving a five-year sentence following his culpable homicide conviction.
