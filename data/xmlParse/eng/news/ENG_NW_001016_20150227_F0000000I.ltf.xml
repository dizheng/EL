593	Two years after losing her husband, Leanne has married a Texas Ranger and the
671	couple had a baby son last month
713	Her father tells Daily Mail Online that her whole family are 'grateful' for 'a
792	real blessing' after the ordeal they have all gone through
860	Leanne has stayed away from the trial, which Chris Kyle's widow attended every
939	day
952	Leanne's father spoke of admiration for Mrs Kyle's 'guts' in being at trial
1028	and said he hopes Eddie Ray Routh's conviction will let her move forward with
1106	her life
1124	The widow of Chad Littlefield, the friend of American Sniper Chris Kyle who
1200	was gunned down at his side, has found happiness two years after the horrific
1278	events at Rough Creek shooting range.
1325	As Eddie Ray Routh, 26, begins his life sentence for the murders of
1393	Littlefield, 35, and Kyle, 38, who he shot in February 2012, Daily Mail Online
1472	can reveal that Leanne Littlefield has remarried and that she and new husband,
1551	Texas Ranger Jason Bobo, welcomed their first child, a son, Alex, just last
1627	month.
1643	Speaking to Daily Mail Online Leanne's father, retired firefighter Thomas
1717	Montgomery told of the family's gratitude at his daughter's second chance at
1794	happiness after such devastation, describing her new life as 'a blessing.'
1878	He said: 'She feels very happy with her new life. She's remarried and
1948	re-located. We feel like it's just a real blessing.'
2010	He explained that the family's main focus has been on protecting and shielding
2089	Leanne and Chad's daughter, Morgan, now 8, from the details of the case as
2164	played out in Stephenville Courthouse across the past two weeks.
2238	Neither Leanne nor her parents, Thomas and Kit, were present at the trial. Mr
2316	Montgomery said he 'didn't see that it would serve any purpose' for them to be
2395	there.
2411	He said: 'There are two kiddos to think about now. We know we can't shield her
2490	forever. The truth will become apparent in time but for now she knows her
2564	daddy is gone and he's in heaven and we just want to protect her as much as
2640	possible.'
2660	Leanne, now 36, was just 22 when she married Chad, then 23. Five years later
2737	their daughter, Morgan, was born.
2780	The day before he died Littlefield told his parents that his life was 'scary
2857	good.' He had a good job; Leanne – then a principal at Walnut Grove Middle
2932	School in Midlothian – had a good job. They were financially secure. Life,
3007	he said, was 'awesome.'
3040	Then, a few minutes at Rough Creek shooting range, where Kyle and Littlefield
3118	had taken former Marine Routh to help the PTSD sufferer assimilate to civilian
3197	life, destroyed everything.
3234	It is testament to her strength of spirit that Leanne has managed to rebuild
3311	and find a new life and a new love in Ranger Bobo whom she married last
3383	summer.
3400	He joined Ellis and Navarro County Rangers in 2010 and IS responsible for
3474	liaison with other law-enforcement agencies in the counties.
3544	Last March Ranger Bobo was honored by the US Attorney's office in Dallas.
3627	He was awarded for his investigative assistance in a multi-agency
3693	investigation that began as a kidnapping/barricaded subject. A resultant
3766	search warrant revealed a street sweeper destructive device, 12 firearms,
3840	hundreds of rounds of ammunition, rifle magazines, marijuana, surveillance
3915	cameras and $150,000 in cash.
3954	According to Mr Montgomery the end of Routh's trial and his conviction is
4028	another vital step in the healing process and in moving forward with their new
4107	lives as a couple and a family.
4148	He said: 'We feel that the jury was just. I'm no psychiatrist. I mean the guy
4226	admitted to doing it and it just came down to what to do with him.
4302	'You know at one time he seemed to be teetering [between sanity and insanity].
4381	Is that cured? Probably not. But we do what the law says and we put him in
4456	jail and we keep him there. I don't know if that's good or bad or
4522	indifferent.'
4545	Unlike Taya Kyle, whose life has been focused on promoting her late husband's
4623	memory through public speaking, book tours and supporting Clint Eastwood's
4698	biopic 'American Sniper' by attending the Oscars, Leanne has chosen a
4768	different path.
4793	According to her father: 'Leanne's the direct opposite of Taya in personality
4871	and I'm not kicking Taya. Taya's a tough old girl. I'm sure she went through
4948	some pretty gut wrenching feelings every time Chris Kyle was deployed and
5022	she's very very tough.
5054	'But I hope for her that now this is over she can back off and get her life to
5133	calm down some.'
5159	Mr Montgomery expressed a hope that all the families involved might now find a
5238	way towards some sort of peace.
5279	He said: 'I hope everybody can move forward – the Littlefields, the Kyles
5353	and even Routh's family because he's got parents and relatives too. I can't
5429	imagine how they feel.
5461	'They've got to live with it for the rest of their lives just like the rest of
5540	us have to live with our loss all because of the actions of one guy. We're
5615	just so grateful for the blessings that Leanne has found.'
5683	HONOR THEIR MEMORY: TEXAS TO NAME HIGHWAY AFTER DEAD HEROES
5752	The Kyle and Littlefield families have both given their blessing to the
5824	passing of a bill that will see a stretch of highway named after Chris Kyle,
5901	38, and Chad Littlefield, 35.
5940	Daily Mail Online can reveal that the families have been assured by senate
6015	representatives that the Texas 84th Legislature currently sitting will push
6091	through the necessary bill.
6128	The move comes as an online petition to have the stretch of HWY 287, which
6203	runs through the men's hometown of Midlothian, named in their honor has gained
6282	close to its target 7,500 signatures.
6329	Taya Kyle gave her blessing to the motion last month with the Littlefield
6403	family joining her in support shortly before the trial began.
6474	A previous attempt to have the Highway renamed in March 2013 was unsuccessful.
6553	But the publicity surrounding Eddie Ray Routh's trial and the release of Clint
6632	Eastwood's Oscar-winning biopic, 'American Sniper,' has seen a surge of
6704	support for the motion.
6737	Speaking to Daily Mail Online Jerry Richardson revealed: 'There had been talk
6815	of naming a school after them but a highway seems more fitting to me. Schools
6893	can come and go but that road will always be there in their honor.'
