94	Obama blames the guy actually responsible for the birth of ISIS for giving birth to ISIS. BASTARD!
281	I'm LOVING the right-wing outrage over this.

526	President Barack Obama traced the origins of Islamic State militants back to the presidency of George W. Bush and the invasion of Iraq back in 2003, arguing that its growth was an unintended consequence of the war.
743	In an interview with Vice News, President Obama said the rise of Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIS/ISIL) can be directly linked to Americas excursion into Iraq under Bush.
920	Two things: One is, ISIL is a direct outgrowth of Al-Qaeda in Iraq that grew out of our invasion, Obama said in an interview with VICE News. Which is an example of unintended consequences. Which is why we should generally aim before we shoot. 
1168	Obama stated that he is confident a coalition consisting of 60 nations will slowly push back ISIL out of Iraq, but added that the challenge of stopping extremism wont stop unless there is a political solution to the internal strife affecting so many countries in the Middle East.
1541	1. Wow, look how long Cheney's right arm is - that is amazing.
1605	n/t
1680	9. No, that's his left...oh, I see.
1717	A ton of bricks, a ton of feathers, it's still gonna hurt.
1846	15. Cheney looks like a ventriloquist with a Bush dummy
1981	40. Yeah, the arm goes up W's butt and out his sleeve!
2037	That's really sumpin'!
2131	61. That's why you never see his back. The head stick and controls are exposed.
2291	26. CHeney came out today and said Obama worst president of all time
2361	I want dickless to be shamed somehow, in a severe way
2486	51. all that exercise raising it and shouting "Sieg Heil!" has had an effect.
2565	pasty white skin results from spending so much time wearing sheets, suppose??
2713	55. OK, what in cheney's background makes you think he's the puppeteer and bush is the
2801	puppet?
2810	The bush family's link to power goes way back, to the Civil war and railroad era.
2893	Cheney's goes back to...cheney. Unless you know something I don't.
3032	63. Even the Bush
3051	family knew W needed help moving his lips. Enter Cheney.
3179	66. and you know the bush family's secret thoughts because....
3316	72. and you know the bush family's secret thoughts because....
3380	Because there are no secrets involved and we can see and hear and have a brain.
3461	How 'bout you?
3547	73. weak.  *you* think bush is dumb &amp; needs a minder, ergo cheney is in charge.  to you,
3641	that means "we can see and hear and have a brain".
3693	or maybe not. just your supposition.
3804	74. Oh please.....
3824	...... what are you even arguing about?
3865	Like we're making scientific analyses instead of snarky jokes.
3929	And having lived thru the Bush years, and having a memory, it was obvious Dubya was not that engaged with that whole governing thing (one page DPB's...he didn't even read, y'know). Not so good for press conferences and PR either but it's what they got. He, like Reagan was a PR President.... a GOP idea.
4234	But
4239	Yes yes, I cannot see into the Bush family collective brain. Nothing about decades of external behavior or incidences and verbiages could possibly give us a clue as to what they are like or how they operate. THANK YOU, ND-Dem, for being so fair and understanding. I grovel.... I grovel in mortification...
4616	79. You do know who picked Cheney to be W's VP, don't you? n/t
4760	2. There's no question how ISIS came about.  These are former
4823	disgruntled Iraqi military officers (under Saddam) and AQ-aligned Sunnis who were too hard to kill the first time around. They went underground like cockroaches and then got the band back together a few years later. It's really that simple.
5136	70. You summed it up perfectly in sound bite form
5187	Bravo!
5271	76. Yes and anyone stupid enough to support those aholes and vote for the IWR is disqualified to be President...
5385	Can everyone at least agree on that?!
5502	3. What this photo says to me:
5534	heil
5617	5. i wish it was saying "bye-bye we're off to the hague"
5745	18. It says "Smile nice for the camera, Georgie, and you can have ice cream after your nap"
5838	to me ...
5920	43. Sprinkles are for winners.
6029	49. Off topic...
6047	but I love that commercial. "Flo" delivers that line so deadpan.
6113	on edit: Added the video for those who haven't seen it. She makes him feel so good for 25 seconds, then buries the knife
6306	52. Never put this creature on my screen again.
6355	I am so sick of that ******* "Flo", I could retch when I see her mug.
6426	(nuttin' personal, awoke!)
6531	53. Ah, come on now....
6556	I hear you, though
6646	60. you're not alone ...
6672	n/t
6754	4. kr
6837	6. Populist President Obama is what we have in power, no need to wait for Warren. Get his back.
7010	42. How exactly is he a "Populist President".  His stands on fracking, the TPP,
7091	indefinite detention, the Patriot Act, torture, war crimes, drone killings, persecution of whistle-blowers and journalists, etc., preclude him from being a "Populist President". Sen Warren wants to control Wall Street, while Pres Obama and Holder are willing to give them a pass. Almost all of Pres Obama's appointees have been conservatives. How again is he "Populist"???
7539	7. ahhh, so this is what prompted Cheney's little outburst
7599	I figured it had something to do with questioning his lying, cheating, reign of terror.
7688	What a petulant man-child
7793	8. Too bad 99.5% of the population will never see nor read this.
7931	45. Oh, they're reading it and, from what I've seen in the social media, people are furious at Obama.
8034	How dare he not accept the blame for ISIS and blame Bush/Cheney on top of that!
8115	When will these liberals (the fact these goofs call Obama a liberal is laughable) start owning up to their mistakes (another good laugh at their skills of projecting).
8284	I've been reading it on FB and other social media for the past day.
8425	10. The easiest, best and most important thing to do
8479	In letting the world and American citizens know that we realize how horrible what we did was, is to prosecute those that committed war crimes.
8695	11. Shithole RT using a real news organizations work....
8753	There should be some kind of international law against that LOL
8889	12. Bush tried to keep us in, kept Gitmo open, and used ultra-Salafists to overthrow Libya and Syria?
9059	48. How sweet.. you're sticking up for bush.
9175	13. IF ONLY we had media that would actually report on this disturbing fact so the President
9269	wouldn't have to. Now it becomes political when it an actual fact.
9337	If only that librul media would do their job.
9468	14. Working on ensuring no bush will ever hold public office again, awesomeness.
9625	16. YES!   n/t
9718	17. If you want to go back further
9754	Really the CIA in Afghanistan was who birthed the large multi national Islamic fighting force that first formed in Afghanistan, then moved to the former Yugoslavia, and finally wound up in Iraq and Syria. You could say we gave the seed money, and really our invasion of Iraq and then what went down in Syria gave it a huge shot in the arm.
10095	I really only think that it can currently be defeated on an ideological basis and by not sending arms to the middle east, because the arms can be captured or sold to them from who we originally give them to. Another important part is to become energy independent. I think Obama actually knows this and is quietly trying to both do it and educate the public. However the GOP, and sadly, too many of our countrymen think that force is somehow an option that will work.
10563	For years after Vietnam we understood this reality. However one bad thing I think about the Gulf War and our success there was that it sort of emboldened the hawks. After the self congratulatory wallowing we were doing after the Gulf War went so well, combined with the fall of the USSR I knew our imperialistic and hawkish elements were going to lead the country down the path of problems again.
11030	19. The war in Kuwait was when Papa put the airfields on Saudi land
11099	infuriating the dormant extremists, namely Bin Laden and ilk.
11233	20. ...
11319	21. why in the hell is the gnewz telling us what stupid head cheeney thinks?
11476	22. Bzzzzzt! This is an RT article and therefore is simply Russian propaganda!
11556	or something like that...
11583	K&amp;R
11666	23. Educate them over there so we don't have to fight them over here.
11810	24. There is a lot of blame to go around
11852	I found Frontline's program "The Rise of Isis" quite interesting.
11919	http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/rise-of-isis/
12045	38. It seemed a bit Hawkish to put U.S. troops on the ground. I don't want to see more young people
12146	killed and or beheaded. We have to encourage the surrounding armies (Sauds etc) to take up the cause. If they want stability in the region then they'll have to step up. The Pentagon loves war as well as the MIC (Military Industrial Complex)
12461	39. I don't know what the solution is
12500	and I don't want to see troops on the ground either. My point in posting the link was to show the blame goes beyond Bush. Obama played a role as well through neglect and ignoring Malaki's purges of the Sunni. The whole thing is a royal screw up, and now we are facing the consequences.
12861	25. Let's give Obama a THIRD TERM as President
12909	Have Pelosi and Reid introduce a Bill to bomb some place that republicans hate, like the MSNBC studio during the weekend so Rachel is safe, and then like the republicans, sneakily bury a sentence in the Bill that allows Obama to run for a third term. He's too good to let go so soon.
13194	Let's do it!
13288	28. A great "I told you so" would be for Obama to be followed by a Walker or Cruz
13371	The stark difference would make some people hang their heads in shame
13442	We were shown this difference when Obama (superman in some respects) took over after W, the worst president of all time.
13564	We saw how different it was and we forgot about it so quickly, some of us did, anyway.
13732	30. Uh...Bad idea.
13752	Allowing an axe murderer in the house because your kids make a mess and talk back ....isn't a very good idea.
13934	29. hear, hear!
14026	34. I've been "threatening" by
14058	conservative friends with a Third Obama term for six years now! Drives them crazy!!
14143	Sounds like a great idea to me .... (except for that constitutional thing.)
14291	57. Michelle.
14306	Third and fourth Obama terms. Beats the alternatives.
14442	27. kicking, rec, shared.   n/t
14551	31. Hillary blamed the rise of ISIS on Obama's "failure" to intervene in Syrian civil war.
14643	http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/hillary-clinton-failure-to-help-syrian-rebels-led-to-the-rise-of-isis/375832/
14850	41. ...and here I was...
14876	thinking that I didn't need another reason to hate Hillary.
15013	44. There's plenty of material no doubt.
15055	Obama could have left her dumb ass in the Senate where she chaired no committees and had no seniority. But he gave her actual foreign policy experience as SOS to bolster her resume that largely consisted of fantastical claims such as bringing peace to Ireland and ducking sniperfire in Tuzla. What does he get for his gracious generosity? She stabs him in the back and self-promotes her hawkish views. She forgets she lost in large part because of her hawkishness, so I look forward to a reckoning that is surely headed her way.
15656	58. What is striking is that HRCs positions are Bibis and the Saudis
15726	She makes that quite clear in her interview that the "maximalist" stance she takes on every issue from Israel's bombing of Gaza to Iran enrichment is essentially the same as Bibi's and the Saudis'.
15925	As she admits, "there is no distance" on these matters - Hillary might as well be Bibi or the Saudi foreign minister.
16044	Does no one else find this remarkable? Are we really expected to quietly accept her nomination as the Democratic candidate for President without even discussion?
16283	65. Yes, it is disturbing.
16311	And ignored for the most part by too many here.
16360	It is my #1 reason, and lord knows there are many, why I cannot and will not vote for her.
16523	67. Thanks for the link to that HRC interview in The Atlantic.  Substantiates a lot ME specifics.
16622	Hillary has been enabling the "maximalist" hard-line positions of the Israeli RW and the Saudis, and will by all indication continue to do so. Clinton, along with the GOP neocons, share responsible for much of the chaos and sectarian violence that is spilling over out of the region. That fact is widely ignored around here. Let's see what we can do about that.
17061	80. I'm in.
17082	Let's see what we can do about that.
17203	75. Thanks for the link
17228	God, I hope Bernie Sanders becomes a Democrat and runs against HRC for the Democratic nomination.
17403	77. Thanks AK for the reminder. With that idiocy and her IWR vote, Hillary succeeds only in embarrassing herself.
17589	32. I think "unintended" is a real stretch.
17634	I believe everything that happened was well planned and quite intentional.
17784	35. +1000
17866	56. yup. what better way to keep the war machine in high gear
17929	than to bomb a country that did nothing to deserve it.
17984	we should have invaded saudi arabia if we were really trying to punish the perpetrators of 9/11.
18150	33. Average age of ISIL recruit is between 16-21
18200	These are the children of the Iraq war.
18241	Would be interesting to know how many ISIL fighters are orphans or had family killed during the Iraq war.
18348	This was my biggest argument against the Iraq war that it would lead to a generation of children growing up with hate and vengence in their heart thus leading to more terrorism and war.
18610	36. Chainee's ventriloquist act is something to see....
18667	And with only one hand!!!
18769	37. Excellent statements. K&amp;R
18875	46. Pass the butter. It will be fun watching their heads explode.
19009	47. The President warned them in Oct 2002 in his speech against invading Iraq.. did they listen? Are
19111	you kidding!
19125	Mahalo Miles
19208	50. Is that Cheney's hand
19235	up the back of W's shirt? The puppet master at work....
19369	54. I thought we were told RT is a worthless source.
19423	That should not even be allowed on DU. My, how time has changed.....
19570	59. The interview is with Vice News, this story reports on that story. The OP used RT's reporting on
19672	Vice News instead of just linking to the interview. Here's the source:
19743	https://news.vice.com/video/president-obama-speaks-with-vice-news
19887	71. Which is exactly what happened when many others have used RT.
19954	But based on the subject matter they are slammed for using "Putin's propaganda". Here not so much....
20129	62. i hate the picture of those two asswip..
20175	pure evil
20254	64. Certainly not unforeseen. And it was only 'unintended' in the sense that
20332	the greedy, arrogant assholes in charge didn't really give a shit about such side effects. They had their short term goals and lots of dick to waggle, and they just barged forward and did it with the the acquiescence of the political establishment and lots of media cover.
20676	68. Saddam was right.
20769	69. Spot on! +1
20859	78. Islamic State owes it's very existence to the Project for the New American Century (PNAC)
20954	"PNAC, co-founded by William Kristol and Robert Kagan, was a neo-conservative think tank (1997-2006) that had strong ties to the American Enterprise Institute.
21114	PNAC is noteworthy for it's focus on Iraq, a preoccupation that began before Bush became president and predates the attacks of September 11, 2001."
