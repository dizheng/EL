94	AIPAC urges Obama to strengthen ties with Netanyahu
222	Source:ToI
234	The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) on Thursday night called on Washington to strengthen its ties with Israel following the reelection of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and castigated the White House for its cool response to the Israeli leaders statements that  contrary to his preelection stance  he supports the two-state solution.
593	Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly and clearly reaffirmed his commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a statement by AIPAC said.
780	Unfortunately, administration spokespersons rebuffed the prime ministers efforts to improve the understandings between Israel and the US, it continued. In contrast to their comments, we urge the administration to further strengthen ties with Americas most reliable and only truly democratic ally in the Middle East.
1102	A solid and unwavering relationship between the US and Israel is in the national security interests of both countries and reflects the values that we both cherish.

1452	1. Obama should tell AIPAC to fuck off. nt
1573	18. Took the words right out of my mouth. n/t
1691	32. Same here.  n/t
1785	40. I could not have said it better than that.
1903	43. I most heartily agree.
2009	45. Hear hear!
2103	2. Go away AIPAC and take Bill Kristol with you on the way
2241	3. They should change their name
2275	Or at least delete the first "A."
2387	4. AIPAC should scold Netanyahu for his dancing away from truth.  He has shown be is not
2477	Trustworthy. He want to talk about Iran's ability to abide by agreements and he goes and pulls his stunts. We should send Tom Cotton and Netanyahu on a field trip to wonder in the wilderness for forty years.
2757	19. I live that 40 years in the wilderness idea for them - neither will be missed nt
2920	27. Hey, no manna either.
3019	33. Except...
3034	they'd destroy the wilderness simply by being there.
3088	Both are a waste of good air that could be put to better use by endangered species.
3250	34. Sorry, didnt mean to harm the wilderness or cause the poor animals to have to
3333	Exist with these two.
3428	35. with any luck
3447	the bears would take care of that.
3560	36. Ok.  but bad meat, let's call in the buzzards.
3684	38. Yeah, buzzards for sure...
3716	but bears are omnivores and eat some pretty nasty stuff. Wouldn't be surprised if they wouldn't touch them after the kill though.
3920	5. AIPAC can go pound sand.
3949	We are not the Palestinians, we aren't forced to kiss Israel's ass. AIPAC always forgets America's interests and puts Israel's first.
4084	And as far as being an ally, that's bullshit. Israel is a liability to us. The only thing reliable about Israel is that it takes the US for granted.
4301	6. Israeli Fascists PAC would be a nice name for them.
4433	7. Shameless rightwing liars and agents of a foreign power.
4494	Let's not pretend that anyone in that organization has the best interests of the United States at heart.
4608	Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly and clearly reaffirmed his commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
4774	Oh please.
4857	13. so which one are we suppose to believe ....the one before he won the election or the
4947	one after???? we now know he lies...either to his people or ours???
5092	14. the one before the election reflects his actual behavior in office
5164	it's also the one Israeli voters wanted, as shown by their election results
5316	8. Obama to AIPAC and Bibi: Go 'way from my window. Leave at your own chosen speed
5400	I'm not the one you want, babe
5431	I'm not the one you need
5456	You say you're lookin' for someone
5491	Who's never weak but always strong
5526	To protect you an' defend you
5556	Whether you are right or wrong
5587	Someone to open each and every door
5623	But it ain't me, babe
5645	No, no, no, it ain't me babe It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.
5713	Go lightly from the ledge, babe
5745	Go lightly on the ground
5770	I'm not the one you want, babe
5801	I will only let your down
5827	You say you're lookin' for someone
5862	Who will promise never to part
5893	Someone to close his eyes for you
5927	Someone to close his heart
5954	Someone who will die for you an' more
5992	But it ain't me, babe
6014	No, no, no, it ain't me babe
6043	It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.
6082	Go melt back into the night
6110	Everything inside is made of stone
6145	There's nothing in here moving
6176	An' anyway I'm not alone
6201	You say you're looking for someone
6236	Who'll pick you up each time you fall
6274	To gather flowers constantly
6303	An' to come each time you call
6334	A lover for you life an' nothing more
6372	But it ain't me, babe
6394	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
6424	It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.
6463	They help orchestrate an affront to a sitting president, including a letter, now they have the
6558	fucking gall to point the blame at Obama while they back peddle for Bibi.
6633	AIPAC, idiots on steroids.
6733	21. That deserves this
6832	24. Thanks! n/t
6920	22. Parts of that sound as if they could have been written for our relationship with Israel
7013	Who's never weak but always strong
7048	To protect you an' defend you
7078	Whether you are right or wrong
7110	All he needs to add is " to veto each and every resolution, whether our policy or not."
7274	23. lol I like that, very clever:
7309	...to veto each and every resolution, whether our policy or not."
7449	9. There really is a Welfare Queen
7485	And it isn't the poor in America.
7591	10. I have never seen any indication that bibi wants
7645	a two-state solution. Never. Not once. Ever.
7765	41. He is just saying that so the next $3,000,000,000 welfare check won't be delayed.
7925	11. This line...
7951	A solid and unwavering relationship between the US and Israel is in the national security interests of both countries
8079	Made me laugh so,sohard. This "unwavering relationship" has brought nothing good to the United States, in terms of security. Quite the opposite.
8299	12. so was Netanyahu lying when he said:
8341	he supported the two state solution?
8379	or when he said (pre-election) he did not support a two-state solution
8451	or when he recently said (post-election) that he supports a two state solution?
8610	20. Yes. n/t
8695	25. Bibi was emboldened by HRC's earlier statement on West Bank: "If I were the Israeli PM,
8788	youre damn right I would expect to have control over security, This was viewed by many as casting Clinton's support for a two-state solution into doubt.http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/hillary-clinton-failure-to-help-syrian-rebels-led-to-the-rise-of-isis/375832/
9078	Apparently, Bibi assumes that the next US President will see things much more his way than does Barack Obama. If Hillary is the nominee, he may be right.
9307	28. and given how little difference there is
9353	between the GOP and Democrats on the subject of Israel you are probably correct. Even progressive heroes like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are remarkably mainstream when it comes to Israel
9621	29. Even if the differences are small, they are significant.  Netanyahu believes he will get away with
9725	this body-slam to Obama because it is so widely presumed that Hillary is the inevitable candidate, and because as she has said, "there is no daylight" between herself and Netanyahu on issues impacting Israel, such as Palestine and Iran. With this context, expect Bibi to get even more maximalist in his positions, and the Mideast to edge ever closer to total war.
10166	31. Clinton also said this:
10203	This is my biggest complaint with the Israeli government. Im a strong supporter of Israel, a strong supporter of their right to defend themselves. But the continuing settlements, which have been denounced by successive American administrations on both sides of the aisle, are clearly a terrible signal to send if,at the same time, you claim youre looking for a two-state solution.
10596	She knows Netanyahu doesn't support the two-state solution. She holds much the same beliefs as Obama, but has always been more willing to pander to the "Israel uber alles" due to her general lack of political courage.
10886	37. The real Hillary here?: "I was often the 'designated yeller'."
10954	During the same interview with CNN, Hillary also alluded to her complicated (theatrical) relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while she was Secretary of State. I was often the designated yeller, she said. Her criticism has been far more muted since leaving the Obama Administration.http://jpupdates.com/2014/07/27/hillary-clinton-bashed-israels-settlement-activity-highlights-yelling-sessions-w-netanyahu/
11388	Bibi can take likely solace in Hillary's deeply-held ambiguity.
11531	15. AIPAC Should Just STFU...
11562	...they have overplayed their hand and worn out their welcome.
11626	..."Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly and clearly".....LIED. He already said what he is committed to doing.
11752	No one left to listen but the legion of hand puppets they own in DC and the puppets are getting lots of pressure from their constituents to quit shilling for these bunch of liars and users.
11943	We do not consent to waging and funding their wars.
11996	It is the time for peace and those who are not with the program can fend for themselves.
12158	16. I urge Obama to tell AIPAC to STFU.[n/t]
12275	17. AIPAC should tell Netanyahu that Obama is our President and is owed respect
12356	if he expects respect in return.
12390	The fact is that Netanyahu lied at least once this week -- and he wants us to accept that there is no difference between the two completely opposite statements.
12552	It is Netanyahu's dishonesty that AIPAC should be asking about -- ie how can Jews in the diaspora defend Israel, when the PM makes thugish unhelpful comments.
12783	26. The best thing we can do right now is to
12829	ignore AIPAC and go balls/walls to improve our relationship with Iran. IMHO
12982	30. Israel is not a democracy.
13089	39. If you believe Bibi really means that, then I want to talk to you
13160	I've got some beachfront property by the Sea of Tranquility that might interest you. Great prices if you buy now.
13275	?fit=580%2C580
13361	46. Hey .. THAT beach has a shower ...
13401	I'm in !
13480	42. That will be easier said than done with boner interferring in everything.
13638	44. President Obama to AIPAC
13668	Go to hell assholes!
13690	Hey maybe AIPAC can funnel more millions in from overseas and bribe more Senators and congressman!!
13791	Thanks SCOTUS! (you fucking traitorous bastards!)
13917	47. If Israel wants to be the friend of the US, its up to Israel to make it work.
14001	The US has no obligation to accept bad behaviour from a supposedly friendly country. Its significant that AIPAC isnt telling Netanyahu to stop destroying the good relationship with the US, instead its the US President who should take the abuse and apologize for having a backbone.
14286	This is exactly why I dont like AIPAC.
14398	48. ''Urges'' = ''Warns''
14425	- Fuck AIPAC.
14514	49. Did they tell how high Obama must jump.
