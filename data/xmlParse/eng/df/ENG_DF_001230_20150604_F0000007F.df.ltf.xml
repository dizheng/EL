1058	Absolutely correct. In order to win the election, they had to put personal interests aside and adopt the most popular candidate, knowing that's the only chance they had at clinching at the presidency. They should also be prepared to make more sacrifices because Buhari is not someone you push around using selfish interest, he cares about his hard earned reputation and legacies and he wants to deliver without much interference...
