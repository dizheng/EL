1257	First OJ and now these boys. Will the conspiracy never end?
1393	An opinion of mine, which I have expressed on this forum before, is that at least half the people in USA jails are there because of their parents.

2923	Hows that Nikkor 80-400 working out?
3031	I did not buy the S version, I bought the screwdriver focus type, which is cheaper of course but not as fast as the S version.  I have mixed feelings about it, it is quite sharp, I like it, but it adds too much weight to my carry-on when travelling, so I have bought the Nikon 70-200 f4 to take with me when travelling and I intend to get the Nikon Teleconverter 1.4 version III to add to it when required. The 80-400 will accompany with me when I shoot around where I live or I am going by car, but to take that in a carry-on will not be possible as I am already over my 7kg carry-on limit.

4792	There was an absolute mountain of evidence against both brothers, even before the younger one's lawyers admitted that he did just about every crime that the prosecution said that he did.  Instead of going with a plea-bargain, the prosecutors insisted on introducing their evidence - and I'm glad they did, because now if the defense retracts their admission, that won't be enough to get him out of the results of the trial.
5217	I would have said that we should feel sorry for the mother for having two sons who turned out to be such ungrateful, rotten terrorists.  But after her promise that the U.S. will "pay" for convicting her darling boy, with the strong implication that we will "pay" in the blood of more innocents, she's not only lost any sympathy, she's gone beyond the boundaries of protected free speech and given law enforcement reason to wonder if she is a risk.

5740	Hey lady, "good luck" ever getting a visa to visit the U.S. again!
5808	BTW, although the younger brother (found guilty on all 30 counts) is eligible for the death penalty (as per the wording of the news report), the jury has not reached a verdict in the penalty phase of the trial that will decide whether he gets it.

7606	I guess when you have a mother fundamentalist so inflated with hate, as a child you don't need bad friends.
7715	Is she not back to Chechenya now? This is the same kind of people who came on a tourist visa and applied for refugee status and would beg the US to let them stay because if they go back they would be tortured and killed.

8535	You could show her all the evidence, and the video's of her son's placing the bombs.  You could show her the video of her son hiding in that boat, for no reason what so ever I guess.  You could show her all the posts where her son's planed on going to New York next.    You could show her the receipts of her son's buying the pressure cookers with their credit cards.  And she would still claim "set up".
8941	Just another case of Mother supporting her criminal sons.  Not that we all haven't seen that enough, right?
9125	If she feels that badly about it...
9162	I'm sure we could give her a ride back to her home country of Chechnya.
9235	You've seen what Putin did to the Ukranians for just getting a bit independent. One can only imagine what he'd do to a Chechen with ties to terrorism.
9387	My guess is the ride from the airport would be a short one.

10652	It is common for criminals to have the unconditional support of their parents.  No matter how many other parents have had their kids killed by the criminal.
10810	In the local area, a young man fled when the police showed up at the family's home.  The police were after his brother and not him.  He just thought they wanted him because of the truck he had stolen.  He took off in the truck and the police followed.  He wound up running over two couples on motorcycles when he ran a red light.  Three people died with one seriously injured.  The young man's parents blamed "that darn truck" the young man had stolen.

13159	It's not that I'm America's biggest fan.
13201	Sure, everyone, even the guilty as hell, should have someone to defend them, which is why I don't so much mind his mother's little rant, but that article isn't about defending him. It's simply anti-American; it's propaganda. It's garbage.
13441	What's more, the article relies on far too many crutches to try and get its argument to stand up.
13540	Firstly, look at the title of the book it attempts to promote,
13604	The Globalisation of War - America's "Long War" against Humanity;
13671	The amount of crutches used tells me that when preaching to the congregation, its fans will just see, "Globalisation, America's war against humanity", and many will just see; America = bad.
13862	But those crutches are glaring. The author has had to use them to try and whip up some credibility.
13963	If the argument can't be made without leaning on feelings /suspicions about 9/11, then it starts to look like a white-wash.
14088	When it has to also lean on similar doubts about the truth surrounding the death of (President) JFK, then it's starting to scrap the barrel.
14230	And when it has clawed away the bottom of the barrel and is spewing out all over the place, as demonstrated by trying to appeal to those who don't much like Obama (yeah, why not drag him in to, eh?), along with quoted 87% of those who feel they "simply do not trust their own government", the notion that the article is aimed at an audience of Americans who hate the USA starts to play out along with the irony that having removed the bottom of the barrel, its barrel of arguments are presented as if assumed to be safely on a sound footing. er, duh! No! They're not.

15112	I had to skim-read that article as I have no time to read lengthy essays on DPR. So are you backing the mother's claim: my darlings are innocent, it was a setup?
