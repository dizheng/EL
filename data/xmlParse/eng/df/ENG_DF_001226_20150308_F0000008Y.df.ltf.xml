94	Where was respect for Reeva Steenkamp, "blade runner" assassin? WTF?
248	Shocked that they would take the murder of Reeva Steenkamp by blade runner Oscar Pistorius and turn it into a Hollywood assassin. Disgraceful.
462	Based on a comic book that came out a few years ago, and the blade-leg character was in it. Settle down.
637	Steenkamp was shot to death. Blade leg chick sliced people up with her legs. I see no comparison.
816	Think of it as Oscar on steriods. I couldn't help but think of the blade runner. Imagine how Steenkamp's family felt?
1006	I bet Oscar wouldn't like the movie. 
1113	The original comics that inspired the movie were released about a year before the murder of Reeva Steenkamp. The comics featured an assassin named Gazelle with the same prosthetic legs, but was a black male. The original source material and subsequent movie adaptation had nothing to do with Ms. Steenkamp's murder. 
1505	That's really scraping the "I'm offended/it's disgusting" barrel. 
1642	Your level of sensitivity is truly pathetic. 
1760	Are you retarded? This comic came out WAY before she was murdered. Also she was shot and not sliced with feet blades. Also Oscar didn't have blades for feet. You're ridiculous.
2014	i actually thought of blade runner when watching the movie, but didn't find it disrespctful
