269	The Republican talking heads are starting to get nervous it seems.
412	Maybe the GOP will take a tip from Netanyahu's successful last-minute nativist racist scare tactic campaign pitch, when he warned of "Arabs voting in droves". Some GOPers have come close to that with various dog whistles (47%, 'urban voters,' 'takers,' etc), but will one actually say "Rise up and stop the Blacks and Mexicans from electing Hillary!"
831	Bill Kristol continues to give Dick Morris a run as most out of touch man in America.
988	New PPP poll will have Netanyahu at 2%. Just watch.
1121	He is probably more popular in the US than a good half of the GOP field.
1273	Apparently CNN doesn't know the difference between RV/LV voter polls and polls of national adults.
1484	He is probably more popular in the US than a good half of the GOP field.
1567	Probably because the GOP has been praising his name and the Democrats are too afraid to trash him because Israel.
1762	In such scenario, I'd probably end up as Clintonbot, worse than IceSpear 
1943	He is probably more popular in the US than a good half of the GOP field.
2026	That's not saying much at all.
2126	How many times do you have to be totally wrong before people stop allowing you on television or quoting in you in otherwise respectable publications?
2394	In such scenario, I'd probably end up as Clintonbot, worse than IceSpear 
2478	Even I would favor a Clinton victory in that scenario.
