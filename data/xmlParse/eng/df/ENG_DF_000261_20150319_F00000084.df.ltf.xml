94	Netanyahu Says He Didn’t Mean Any of It, Loves America, Could Maybe Be OK With a Palestinian State 
277	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has wasted no time in trying to walk back the rhetoric used in the closing days of his ultimately successful re-election campaign. Tellingly, he chose to do so in the American media, telling NBC’s Andrea Mitchellthat America has no greater ally than Israel and Israel has no greater ally than the United States.”
633	This comes after a campaign that included a commercial arguing that Israel wouldn’t exist if it always listened to America, an allegation that U.S. money was driving high Arab turnout, and, of course, a speech to the U.S. Congress that infuriated the Obama administration and many Democrats. President Obama has not yet called to congratulate Netanyahu on his victory, and White House officials say Netanyahu’s campaign comments, which included a disavowal of Palestinian statehood, could lead to a “reassessment” of the U.S.-Israeli relationship.

3518	Bibi said America has no greater ally than Israel. Israel is a staunch ally of the US but that comment alone just shows Bibi's arrogance and ignorance of other Countries relationship with the US. 
3716	My Country remains the only country to have served loyally alongside the United States in every major conflict since WWII. Netanyahu needs to get over himself. His Country is no more a greater Ally to the US than mine has ever been.
