94	Congrat Buhari.... Nigeria's President-elect
217	The election 2015 has been won and lost with the incumbent defeated. I congratulate the winner General Muhammadu Buhari, his party and his supporters for pulling such feat of defeating an incumbent for the first time in Nigeria. Though the PDP is contesting some of the results announced in FOUR States, yet it is a victory that deserves celebration for the APC except the Court decide otherwise.
615	With respect to my eleventh hour defection to the PDP camp, let me reiterate that I have no regret for my decision. I have to also state that I was never compromised by any political party or government to influence my change of camp. I was passionate for APC and Buhari then, I am passionate for GEJ and the reformed PDP now. I wish Buhari well in the running of his government. My integrity is more important than anything. 
1043	To the PDP, I urge them to take the electoral defeat as an opportunity to re-build the party and make it attractive to patriotic Nigerians. The unpopular people in the party need to be phased out for new breed of smart, passionate, patriotic and young politicians. If they have any complaint, the legal process should be explored and not the show of shame as acted by Mr Godsday Orubebe.
1432	To President Jonathan, He lost the popular votes but he kept to his word of not interfering with the process. I sympathise with him and all supporters for his loss at the poll. The most important and honorable thing is that he be ready to handover power come May 29. He should resist any advice from any quarter to perpetuate himself in power beyond the May 29 expiry date.
1807	As for my Brothers and Sisters in the SS and SE, I urge them to accept the will of the people but be rest assured that the struggle for better living will not end with Jonathan's exit from power. We shall continue to demand for better living of our people and the entire Nigerians. 
2091	I congratulate General Buhari once again,his numerous supporters and party. I wish Buhari well in his incoming administration.
2219	God Bless Us All

3450	It was a clueless move when u left APC and more clueless was ur description of GMB,in one of ur posts after leaving APC,as insincere.
3585	However,the door of change never closes for any upright mind.
3648	Barcanista u dnt belong to them.Accept ur mistakes and move on.You are still not as bad as FFK for god's sake.
3760	Looking forward to ur coming back to where u belong.Dont mind what they will say,mind what's right.

6466	Your betrayal of APC and joining the TANoids was of great benefit to the progressives. The entire Webosphere saw the kind of characters supporting JonaTAN. Traitors, turncoats, liars, and those ready to sell their birthright for mere pittance. 
6712	Your posts against Jonathan in the early days made many to reject Jonathan, but your defection made more undecided voters see through the garment of deceit clothing you and your ilk. 
6897	Your disservice was your greatest service to the Buhari cause. 
6962	Thank you very much as you take your ignoble position in the dustbin of history.

11589	Even if your belief in GMB's candidacy wavered , going back to PDP who you had castigated put you in bad light, a reasonable person would have abstained from the election altogether, but by going back to ur vomit, you showed us your views about pdp all this while was fake, you yourself didn't belief your own views or principles, you just wanted popularity. Well you have your popularity now, there is no difference between you and FFK, and Nigerians have shown that they don't want the likes of you, if u were to get to power, you probably will have no principles or ideology. I don't take you serious anymore, I'm only replying this so as to dissuade those who might be decieved by your new gestures . 
12296	I wish you Goodluck
